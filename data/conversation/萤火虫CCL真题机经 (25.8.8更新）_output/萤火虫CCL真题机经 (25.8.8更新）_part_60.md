7. The reason your paper isn’t as good as it could be is the structure of your essay.
Your ideas are fine, but the paper lacks a clear logical flow.
（你论文成绩不理想的原因在于文章的结构。你的观点没问题，但论文缺乏清晰的
逻辑性。）
8. 哦。我的论文里确实有几个部分是最后几分钟才写的，所以写得比较仓促。我担心
涵盖不了题目的所有要求。
(Oh. There were indeed a few parts in my paper that I wrote in the final minutes, so they
ended up a bit rushed. I was worried that I wouldn’t cover all the requirements of the
topic.)
9. I see. That might explain why your arguments aren’t set up well. It’s often not a
good idea to keep reworking your paper.
（我明白了。这或许能解释为什么你的论点组织得不够好。不断地反复修改论文往
往不是个好主意。）
10. 我确实有这么做。我发现这篇论文比我想象中要难写，因为需要涵盖很多内容。
(I did keep reworking it. I found that this paper was harder to write than I imagined
because there was so much to cover.)
11. It is indeed a complicated topic. It’s easy to lose direction, especially for
university-level assignments.
（这个话题确实复杂。很容易迷失方向，尤其是大学程度的作业。）
12. 这跟我的中学作业不太一样。我想取得好成绩，但我真的需要帮助。
(It’s not like my secondary school assignments. I want to get good grades, but I really
need some help.)
13. I know a teacher who offers great tutoring sessions on writing papers for first-year
students every week. I can give you the details if you’re interested.

（我认识一位老师，每周都会给大一新生进行论文写作辅导，效果很不错。如果你
有兴趣，我可以把详细情况告诉你。）
14. 好的，谢谢您。这听起来真是个好主意。我相信这会对我下一次写论文大有帮助。
(Okay, thank you. That sounds like a great idea. I believe it will really help me improve
my next paper.)

#70189. Helping Hands for a Neighbourhood Park
–
Social
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking resident and
an English-speaking community center staff. They are discussing ways for the resident
to get involved in the neighborhood. The dialogue starts now.
1. Good afternoon! Come in and take a seat, please. My co-worker mentioned that you
were interested in our volunteer program.
（下午好！请进，坐吧。我同事说你对我们的志愿者项目感兴趣。）
2. 下午好！是的，我刚搬到这个社区一个月，想了解怎么更好地融入这里，多认识一
些朋友。
(Good afternoon! Yes, I just moved to this neighbourhood a month ago, and I’d love to
find ways to get more involved and make new friends.)
3. We’re always in need of more volunteers. None of our community projects would be
possible without the volunteers who dedicate their time.
（我们这边总是需要更多志愿者。如果没有这些热心奉献的志愿者，我们的社区项
目根本无法实现。）
4. 我在家工作，所以时间比较灵活。每周我能抽出几个小时做志愿者，而且也希望能
认识更多人。
(I work from home, so my schedule is pretty flexible. I can spare a few hours each week
for volunteering, and I’d love to meet more people.)
5. Many of our volunteers end up becoming good friends. Do you have any specific
interests? We can try to match you with a project that suits you.
（我们很多志愿者最后都成了好朋友。你对什么特别感兴趣吗？我们可以帮你找到
一个适合你的项目。）

6. 我其实什么都愿意做，但我特别喜欢园艺和种植。我家里正在弄个小菜园。
(I’m open to anything, but I really enjoy gardening and planting. I’m actually working on
a small vegetable garden at home.)
7. That’s perfect! We have a project that would be a great fit for you. We're fixing up
the park near the shopping center.
（太棒了！我们正好有个非常适合你的项目——修缮购物中心附近的公园。）
8. 其实我前几天也注意到了，公园里的灌木丛确实需要修剪，杂草也长得到处都是，
整个地方看起来不太美观。
(I actually noticed that a few days ago. The bushes definitely need trimming, and the
weeds are everywhere. The park doesn’t look great right now.)
9. We need people with some gardening experience who can help clean up the space.
Everything is overgrown and needs a lot of trimming.
（我们需要有园艺经验的人帮忙整理公园。现在那里杂草丛生，需要好好修剪一下。）
10. 我会修剪树枝，也懂一点园艺。公园如果整理好了，肯定会变得很漂亮。而且，它
还能给社区添上一块舒适的绿色空间。
(I have experience trimming branches and know a bit about gardening. Once the park is
cleaned up, it’ll definitely look beautiful. Plus, it’ll give the community a nice green space
to enjoy.)
11. There’s quite a bit of work to do, but I believe the park will look amazing once it’s
done. We’re also planning to install new benches to make it more inviting.
（这项工作量不小，但等公园整理好后，肯定会焕然一新。而且，我们还计划安装
新的长椅，让公园更有吸引力。）
12. 公园对整个社区来说真的很重要。人们需要一个可以散步的地方，或者只是坐下来
放松一下，享受新鲜空气。

(Parks are really important for the whole community. People need a space where they can
take a walk or just sit down and relax in the fresh air.)
13. Yes, and we’re lucky to have raised enough donations to restore it. Everyone is
looking forward to the reopening.
（是啊，而且我们已经筹集到了足够的捐款来修缮公园，大家都在期待它重新开放。）
14. 我很高兴能参与这个项目，帮助改善公园的环境。这不仅能让公园更漂亮，还能让
整个社区变得更适合居住。
(I’m really happy to be a part of the project and help improve the park. It’s not just about
making it look nicer—it’ll also make the whole neighbourhood a better place to live.)

#70190. From Crib to Platform Bed – Social+Business
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking homeowner
and her English-speaking friend. They are discussing house decoration ideas. The
dialogue starts now.
1. Hey! It’s so nice to see you again. It feels like forever since we last caught up. How
have you been?
（嗨！再见到你真好。感觉我们很久没聊天了，你最近怎么样？）
2. 是啊，好一阵子没见了。这段时间我一直忙着装修家里，现在终于搞定了。总算可
以好好享受新家的感觉了！
(Yeah, it’s been a while! I’ve been caught up with renovating my home and now it’s
finally done. I can finally enjoy my new home!)
3. That’s awesome! I remember when you showed me your renovation plans. It felt like
a huge project. Did everything go as planned?
（太棒了！我记得你之前给我看过装修计划，感觉是个大工程。一切顺利吗？）
4. 是的，整体来说都挺顺利的。幸运的是，我们找到了一家很靠谱的建筑公司，大工
程已经完成了。现在我们正忙着做最后的装饰，让家更有个性。
(Yeah, overall, everything went pretty smoothly. Luckily, we found a great contractor, and
the big work is done. Now we’re just focusing on decorating and adding some personal
touches.)
5. Totally! Decorating the entire house must be exhausting, especially with so many
decisions to make. It can be overwhelming!
（完全同意！给整个房子做装饰肯定是件大工程，特别是要选那么多东西，会很有
压力。）

6. 我们每次只装饰一个房间，这样不会太赶。反正也不赶时间，这样还能慢慢挑喜欢
的东西，不会买了又后悔。
(We’re taking it one room at a time, so it doesn’t feel too overwhelming. There’s no rush
anyway, and this way, we can carefully pick things we really love instead of making
impulsive choices.)
7. That’s a great approach! Taking your time means you can really make sure
everything turns out just the way you want. What room are you working on at the
moment?
（这种方式很棒！慢慢来才能装出自己真正喜欢的感觉。你现在在弄哪个房间？）
8. 我现在在装饰我女儿的房间。她马上要从婴儿床换成大的平台床了。她成长得实在
是太快了！感觉昨天她还在学走路呢！
(I’m decorating my daughter’s room right now. She’s about to move from her crib to a
bigger platform bed—it’s crazy how fast she’s growing! Feels like just yesterday she was
learning to walk!)
9. Switching to a platform bed is an important milestone! There are so many great bed
options, and some even come with built-in storage.
（换平台床可是个重要的里程碑呀。现在很多床都不错，有些还带储物功能。）
10. 对啊，这太方便了！儿童房的储物真的很重要，所以我想买一个能用很多年的床，
最好是她能一直睡到青少年时期的。

(Yeah, that would be so convenient! Storage is a huge deal in a kid’s room, so I want to
get her a bed that’ll last for years, hopefully even into her teenage years.)
11. That’s a smart choice. You don’t want to redecorate too soon, so getting something
that lasts makes a lot of sense.
（这个想法很明智，没人想这么快又重新装修，买个耐用的确实更划算。）
12. 我们也这么想。所以，我们喜欢简单素净的设计，然后用小地毯这种容易换的小东
西来增加一些鲜艳的色彩。
(We feel the same way. That’s why we go for simple and neutral designs and add some
bright colors with easy-to-swap items like rugs.)
13. That sounds perfect! I can’t wait to see how your place turns out when everything’s
done. I bet it’s going to look fantastic!
（听起来很棒！我特别期待看看你家装好的样子。我觉得肯定会超级好看！）
14. 我也很期待让你过来看看！不过估计还得花点时间。慢慢装饰才能让家更有感觉，
我不想匆匆忙忙地搞定它。
(I’m looking forward to having you over too! But it’ll probably take a little more time.
Taking it slow makes a home feel more like home/ makes a home feel more inviting—I
don’t want to rush it.)【注：固定句型Make + 宾语+ 动词原形（不加s）】

#70191. Navigating
Customer
Service
Challenges
–
Business
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking store owner
and a Mandarin-speaking new employee. They are discussing the employee’s progress at
work and how to handle customer service challenges. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hi, great to see you! Come on in and have a seat. I wanted to check：how's the new
job treating you?
（嗨，见到你真高兴！快进来坐吧。我想问问，你的新工作怎么样？）
2. 很好，谢谢！最近工作挺忙的，不过我喜欢这种忙碌的感觉，这样上班时间会过得
特别快。
(It's going really well, thanks! Work’s been pretty hectic lately, but I enjoy staying busy. It
really makes the workday fly by / This makes me feel like the workday just flies by / Time
at work goes by so fast when it’s like this / Work hours pass so quickly when things are
like this.)
3. Yeah, I get that. I had a chat with your supervisor, and he mentioned that you're
doing great and picking things up really fast.
（是啊，我理解。我和你的主管聊过，他说你表现得很棒，学东西也特别快。）
4. 我很高兴他对我的工作满意。毕竟我已经干了几个星期了，现在感觉越来越有自信
了。
(I’m really glad to hear that he’s happy with my work. After all, I’ve been here for a few
weeks now, so I’m starting to feel more confident.)
5. The more you interact with customers, the more confident you’ll get. Providing good
customer service is key.
（接触的顾客越多，你的信心就会越足。高质量的客户服务很重要。）

6. 确实。我很喜欢跟顾客交流，帮他们找到最好的解决方案。但说实话，这并不简单。
(Absolutely. I really enjoy talking to customers and figuring out the best way to help them.
But honestly, it’s not always easy.)
7. So true. Even if a business has a great system in place, issues still pop up. And when
they do, customers tend to get even more frustrated. Have you run into any tough
situations?
（没错。就算生意的运营流程很好，还是会出现问题。一旦有问题，顾客往往会更
不高兴。你遇到过难处理的情况吗？）
8. 是的。有人把本该打折的商品按原价卖给了顾客。那位女士回家后才发现，她非常
郁闷。
(Yeah. Someone sold a discounted item at full price to a customer / Someone charged a
customer full price for something that was supposed to be discounted. The customer
didn’t realize it until she got home, and she was really upset.)
9. Oh no! I can totally see why she’d be mad：it must’ve been such a hassle for her. I
hope you were able to sort it out.
（哎呀！我完全能理解她为什么生气，这对她来说肯定很麻烦。希望你已经把问题
解决了。）
10. 是的，我纠正了这个错误，退还了差价。但她还是很生气，我真不知道还能怎么做。
(Yeah, I fixed the mistake and refunded the price difference. But she was still pretty upset,
and I wasn’t sure what else I could do.)
11. In situations like that, you could offer her a discount voucher for her next purchase.
Just be sure to check with your supervisor first.
（遇到这种情况，你可以给她一张下次购物的折扣券。不过要先跟你主管确认一下。）
12. 哦！我明白了。如果当时我给她折扣券，她可能就有不一样的反应了。我知道她是
我们的常客。
