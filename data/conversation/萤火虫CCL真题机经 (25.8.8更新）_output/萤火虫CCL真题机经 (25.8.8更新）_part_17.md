#70045. Legal Aid - Legal
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Mr. Shi, a mandarin speaking
client, and a legal-aid lawyer. Mr. Shi is making an initial consultation regarding his
legal aid application. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Good afternoon, Mr. Shi. First, I want to ask you a few routine questions. Can I
confirm with you that you'd like to apply for Legal Aid?
(施/史先生，下午好。首先，我要问你几个常规问题。我跟你确认一下: 你要申请法
律援助吗？)
2.
当然了。我本来想请私人律师，但是我的餐厅生意不好，赚钱不多，我也没有多少
存款。我所有的钱都用来养家糊口了。
(Sure. I planned to engage a private lawyer; however, my restaurant is not running well
and it’s not making a lot of money. I don’t have too much money saved. All my money is
used to support/feed the family.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Savings 作为存款/ 积蓄的时候要用复数；"savings" (total amount. saved) is
countable in some but not all grammatical contexts. And that we normally avoid the
uncountable use.

请律师往往习惯说engage a lawyer, 而不是hire a lawyer.
3.
Okay. You can then fill in this application form after this consultation. According to
the court summons, you are charged with handling stolen goods and possession of
suspected stolen goods.
(好的。那么在这次咨询结束后，你可以填一下这个申请表。根据法院传票，你被指
控处理赃物以及持有疑似赃物。)
4.
我冤枉啊！当我在警察局做口供的时候，我就说过。那天是端午节，我们一家人正
在吃粽子，突然警察就来到我家，指控我们处理赃物。太可怕了。

(I’m so wronged! I explained this when I was giving a statement in the police station. It
was the Dragon Boat Festival, and my family and I were eating Zongzi. All of a sudden,
the police came to my home and charged us with handling stolen goods. It’s so scary.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

You can refer to the official account of events which a suspect or a witness gives to
the police as a statement. (嫌犯或证人向警方提供的) 陈述; 证词；口供。
例：The 350-page report was based on statements from witnesses to the events. 这份
350 页的报告基于该事件目击者的证词
5.
According to the paperwork, you have large amount of second hand electrical
appliances stocked in your restaurant’s store room. Could you please explain why
you have them and what they’re used for?
(根据文件显示，你把大量二手家电囤积在你餐厅的储藏室里。你可以解释一下你为
什么会有这些家电，以及这些家电是用来做什么的吗？)
6.
我真是有口也说不清啊！那天，一群年轻的地痞流氓突然闯进我的餐厅，逼我买二
手家电。他们还威胁我说，如果我不全部买下来，他们就要砸烂我的餐厅。
(I feel so wronged! A group of young thugs/gangsters stormed/rushed into my restaurant
that day and forced me to buy some used/second hand home appliances. They threatened
me that they would smash my restaurant if I didn’t buy them all.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

有口说不清，还是冤枉，跳进黄河洗不清的意思，所以不建议翻“I can’t explain it”，
依然要把委屈冤枉的感觉翻出来。可以说：I feel so wronged!或者I feel so
falsely/wrongly accused!或者Now it seems futile for me to argue.
7.
The police have already arrested those young people. They have confessed that they
stole these from the nearby apartments. Well, it was alleged that you purchased
stolen goods at a low price and resold them to make profit. Did you know that that is
illegal?

(警察已经逮捕了这些年轻人。他们承认他们是在附近的公寓偷盗了这些家电。据说
你低价购入赃物，之后再重新卖掉来赚钱/获利。你知道这是违法的吗？)
【萤火虫老师tips】

Despite the repetition, ‘that’ is better than ‘it’ – we’re not replacing a noun with a
pronoun, we’re referring back to a whole clause.
8.
我也是没办法啊！那群小混混老是来我的餐厅。这些地痞流氓让我太害怕了。他们
对移民有偏见。吃完饭，我让他们付钱，他们经常就走掉了。
(I really had no choice! Those hooligans always came to my restaurant. I’m so scared of
these thugs/gangsters. They have prejudice against migrants. After they finished their
meals and when I asked them to pay, they always just left.)
9.
You must understand that if you are found guilty, you may receive penalties such as
a fine, Good Behavior Bond or community service, or even a prison sentence.
(你一定得明白，如果你被判有罪，你可能面临的处罚有：罚款，守行令，或者社区
服务，甚至监狱服刑。)
10. 这太可怕了！我没有任何前科。要是我能有资格获得法律援助，我希望你们可以出
庭帮我打官司。
(That’s so scary! I don’t have any previous criminal records. I hope that you can appear
in court and help me with my case if I’m eligible for legal aid.)

12. 好的，谢谢您抽出宝贵的时间见我。一旦我收到法律援助中心的回复，我就会联系

#70046. Year 8 Immunization program - Medical
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a nurse and a mandarin speaking
mother, whose child is currently in year 8. The mother is making an enquiry regarding
her son’s immunization. The dialogue starts now.
1.
你好，我收到你们一封关于儿童免疫接种的信。我能问一下，这封信是讲什么的吗？
(Hello, I received a letter from you concerning immunisation for children. May I ask
what this letter is about?)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

注意最后一句，宾语从句+疑问句的时候，疑问句需要改用陈述句语序。
2.
Let me see. Yes, Year 8 students are offered free vaccines through the National
Immunization Program to protect against some diseases.
(让我看一下。是的，八年级的学生可以通过国民免疫计划，免费接种疫苗，来抵御
一些疾病。)
3.
原来是这样。那我需要做些什么呢？
(I see. What do I need to do then?)
4.
You need to read the Consent Form and Vaccine Fact Sheet carefully, and then sign
the Consent Form.
(你需要仔细阅读同意书和疫苗的情况说明书，然后在同意书上签字。)
5.
好的。那我需要在同意书上填写我儿子的健康状况和过敏史吗？
(Okay. Do I need to include my son’s health condition and allergies in the Consent
Form?)
6.
Yes. You need to fill in the form regarding your child's allergy history to make sure
that he has no severe allergies caused by vaccines. Has he had any allergic reactions

before?
(是的。你需要在表格上填写你孩子的过敏史，确保他没有疫苗引起的严重过敏反应。
他之前有过敏反应吗？)
7.
是的。他的免疫力不太好。之前接种免疫以后，他会发低烧，而且脸和身体其他部
位会起疹子。
(Yes. He has low immunity. He would have a low-grade fever after immunization and
he’s also prone to have rashes on his face and other parts of the body.)
8.
Okay, I'll note that down. Do you think that his allergic reaction may have been
triggered by some medication?
(好的。我会把这些记下来。你觉得他的过敏反应会不会是其他药物引起的？)
9.
我孩子并没有定期服用什么药物啊。我想问一下，接种疫苗也会导致过敏发生吗？
(My child is not on medication. If I may ask: can immunization cause allergies?)
10. Well, severe side effects after vaccination are not common cases. There are usually
underlying causes.
(嗯，接种免疫后，严重的副作用并不多见。通常还会有根本原因。)
11. 您说的根本原因是指什么呢？
(What do you mean by underlying causes?)
12. It may have something to do with his immune system. Maybe he's allergic to
something, or maybe he's on regular medication that may weaken his immune
system.
(可能是跟他的免疫系统有关。可能他对什么过敏，或者可能是他正在服用降低免疫
力的药物。)

13. 我倒是没注意到我儿子对什么过敏。他也没有长期服用降低免疫力的药物。接种完
免疫，我可以给他吃止痛药吗？
(I haven’t been aware of any allergies of him. He’s not on any medication that may
weaken his immune system either. Can I give him pain-killers after immunization?)
14. Yes. You can get over-the-counter pain relief from any pharmacy or supermarket.
Also, you can apply an ice pack to the injection area if it is bruised, red or swollen
after the immunization.
(可以的。你可以在任何药店或者超市买到非处方药版的止痛药。如果在接种免疫以
后，注射部位出现淤青或者红肿，你还可以用冰袋冷敷。)
15. 好的。如果接种免疫以后有什么副作用，我可以联系你们吗？
(Okay. Can I contact you if there’s any side effect after immunization?)
16. Sure. If you need any medical advice, you can contact us online or give us a call.
(当然可以。如果你需要任何医疗建议，你可以在网上联系我们，或者给我们打电话。)
17. 好的，我记下来了。我需要在哪签字呢？
(Okay. I’ll note it down. Where should I sign?)
18. Okay. Please tick the red or green box in the consent form, to indicate which
vaccines you are consenting to, and any you are not, then sign in the space provided
at the bottom.
(好的。请在同意书上面红色或者绿色的方框里面打勾，以便我们知道你同意和不同
意接种哪些疫苗。然后请在底部空白处签字。)

#70047. Blood Test - Medical
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a mandarin-speaking male patient
with a blood phobia and a nurse at a local clinic. The patient is about to have a blood
test. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Good morning! Won't you come in? What seems to be the problem?
(早上好！请进！您怎么了？)
2.
您好，我是来验血的。我有医生的转诊信。
(Hello. I’m here to have a blood test. I have a referral letter from a doctor.)
3.
Well, you've come to the right place. Let me have a look at the referral letter.
(那您就来对地方啦。让我来看一眼转诊信。)
4.
给您。我一见到血就头晕。我现在有一点紧张。
(Here it is. I feel dizzy at the sight of blood. I’m a little nervous now.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

晕血，习惯的口语说法还是faint at the sight of blood, CCL 三分钟中翻英课堂里
面也有配合美剧的讲解，可以翻阅一下加深印象
5.
Don’t worry, you’ll only feel a prick when the needle first pierces your skin. We can
also use a numbing spray to numb the area before I draw the blood.
(别担心。针头刚扎入你的皮肤时，你只会感觉到一点点刺痛。在抽血之前，我们还
会用麻醉喷雾来麻醉注射区域的。)
6.
哎呀，我一见到血就头晕。我真的不行，看到血我真会晕倒。我一想到血，或者一
提到血，也会觉得头晕。

(Gosh, I feel dizzy at the sight of blood. I really can’t do it. I'll literally faint at the sight
of blood. Even the thought of blood or the mere mention of blood can make me feel
dizzy.)
7.
Just relax and take a deep breath. Are you right or left-handed?
(您就放轻松，深呼吸。您惯用右手还是左手呢？)
8.
我是右撇子。不过您为什么问这个呢？这个和验血有关吗？
(I’m right-handed. But why would you ask that? Does it have anything to do with my
blood test?)
9.
If it's the arm you often use, you may have some bruising or swelling where the
blood was drawn.
To make yourself more comfortable, you can lie down and look
away, instead of sitting up. You can even pretend that you are relaxing on a beach to
distract yourself.
(如果在你常常使用的胳膊上抽血，抽过血的地方可能会有淤青和肿痛。你还可以躺
下, 或者看向另一边，不用坐着。你甚至还可以想象你正在沙滩上休息，来转移注
意力。)
10. 这主意不错。我只需要深呼吸来帮我放松。我可以想象在一个风光明媚的日子里，
我在一个美丽的瀑布旁边。
(That’s a good idea. I just need to take a deep breath, which can help me relax. I can
imagine that it’s a lovely sunny day and I’m next to a beautiful waterfall.)
11. Okay. Please make a fist and I'll tell you when to unclench it.
I need to see the vein.
Okay, all done. You can sit up when you're ready. Please sign your name here.
(好的。请您握拳，需要松开手的时候我会告诉您的。我需要看到血管。好的，都做
完了，您觉得可以的时候就能坐起来了/您整理好就可以坐起来了。请在这里签上您
的名字。)
