5. This is a no-payment occupation. But things may change next year if we get a fund
from the Government program.
(这份工作是无薪的。但是如果我们能从该项政府计划中申请到(专项)资金，明年可
能就不一样了。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Fund 这个词，如果是一笔固定好的专用款，就是可数名词, 可以翻译成“专项资
金”或者“专款”；如果是为了某个目的，筹集大家的钱，你捐点，我捐点，就是
复数名词funds，可以翻译成“资金”。

我提升英语能力。

#70110. Rent a house with a massive living space –
Business
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between Sally, an English-speaking real
estate agent and a Mandarin-speaking potential tenant, who is interested to rent a house.
The dialogue starts now.
1. Hi, I’m Sally from the real estate agency. Welcome to our house inspection. Would
you like to have a tour?
(你好，我是房产中介的莎莉。欢迎来看房。你想参观一下吗？)
2. 好的，谢谢你。我在看你们网站的时候，看到你们有一栋房子要出租。
(Okay, thank you. When I was checking your website, I saw that there’s a house for rent.)
3. That’s right. The lease of the previous tenant ended, and he decided not to renew the
lease. The house owner wants to get a new tenant as soon as possible.
(是的。之前租客的租约到期了，他也决定不续租了。房主想要尽快找到新的租客。)
4. 这个房子太适合我们家庭了。我们现在租在一个小公寓，没有足够的空间给孩子。
我们经常被他们的玩具给绊倒。
(This house is a perfect fit for our family. We are currently living in a small rental
apartment and there’s not enough space for our kids. We often trip over their toys. )
5. That must be very difficult for you. This house is perfect for family. There are 3
bedrooms, and a massive living space.
It’s very close to shops, clubs, and train
stations.
(这对你们来说肯定很麻烦吧。这栋房子非常适合家庭居住。它有三个卧室，还有一
个超大的起居室。它离商店，俱乐部和火车站都非常近。)
6. 这个地点太棒了。而且又很靠近我上英语课的地方，只需要短短的步行距离。我很
想要住在这里。

popular. You need to fill in the application form quickly if you want to get it

#70111. speech therapist appointment – Medical
Briefing ：The following dialogue takes place over the phone between Emma, an
English-speaking health nurse and a Mandarin-speaking parent. The dialogue starts
now.
【萤火虫老师Tips】
这个对话有几段之前的几个回忆都不是很完整，所以如果大家考到，要仔细听原文。
1. Hello, this is Emma, the health nurse. I'm calling to talk about your speech therapist
appointment.
(你好。我是保健护士艾玛。我打电话过来是想跟你说一下你语言治疗师预约的事
情。)
2. 你好艾玛，我一直在等您的电话。希望是好消息。
(Hi, Emma. I’ve been waiting for your call. I hope it’s good news.)
3. Yes, it is very good news. I checked with the local health service, and there will be a
speech therapist at the clinic next Thursday.
(是的。是好消息。我跟当地的公共医疗机构确过了，下周四诊所会有一名语言治疗
师。)
4. 太好了。我很担心我女儿落后其他的孩子。她快四岁了，但说话仍有困难。因为她
口吃的问题，让我们非常焦虑。
(That’s great. I’m worried that my daughter may fall behind other kids. She is about to
turn four years old, but it’s still difficult for her to speak. We are very anxious because of
her stammer.)
5. I can understand. My son used to have the same problem when he was young. But I
think he improved a lot after he talked with the speech therapist.
(我明白。我儿子在小的时候也曾经有同样的问题。但是我觉得他跟语言治疗师聊过

以后好了很多。)
6. 那我就有信心了。我想让她马上得到帮助。这对我们非常重要。因为英语是我们的
第二语言。
(Then I have some confidence. I want her to get help immediately. This is very important
to us because English is our second language.)
7. I know she understands what others say to her. I think the speech therapist can help
her make good progress. I hope your daughter could improve as the treatment is
going on.
(我知道她能听懂别人跟她说的话。我想语言治疗师可以帮她很好地进步的。我希望
随着治疗的进行，你女儿的情况可以改善。)
8. 我希望您说的是对的。您说治疗师下周四会来诊所，能请您告诉我治疗师是男性还
是女性呢？
(I hope you are right. You said the therapist will come to the clinic next Thursday. Could
you let me know if the therapist is a male or a female?)
9. Sorry, I do not know about that. There are two therapists at the clinic, and the roster
changes.
(抱歉，这个我不清楚。诊所有两位治疗师，排班表是会换的。)
10. 这么说，我女儿每次会见到不同的语言治疗师，对吗？如果可能的话，我希望我女
儿一直接受同一个治疗师的治疗。
(That means my daughter would meet different speech therapist each time, right? If it’s
possible, I hope my daughter could always be treated by the same therapist. )
11. Please, don't worry. I'm sure it will be the same therapist. I'm just not sure which
one. The appointment will be at 3pm, if it is suitable.
( 请您别担心。我能肯定会是同一位治疗师的。我只是不确定是哪一位。如果可以
的话，给你们预约的时间是在下午三点钟。)

12. 那太好了，我们会准时到那的。请问一个疗程的费用是多少？
(That’s great. We’ll be there on time. May I ask how much it is for one course?)
13. The government contributes to the fee. So, you only need to pay small part of it. I
will check with the therapist and let you know before the appointment.
(政府会出一部分费用的，因此你们只需要付一小部分。我会跟治疗师确认一下，在
预约时间之前告诉您。)
14. 很高兴我们这么快能预约上。我会等你的来电，谢谢。
(I’m happy that we get to have the appointment this quickly. I’ll wait for you call. Thank
you. )

Steve. You could take the other one.

4. 太好了。我在租房广告上看到租金是110 澳元每周。请问这包括水电费吗？
(That’s great. I saw on the rental ad that the rent is 110 dollars per week. May I ask if that
includes the utility bill?)
5. No. Steve and I pay an extra 15 dollars per week to cover the utility bills. You can do
the same if you move in.
(不包括的。我和史蒂夫每周水电费会额外再交15 澳币。你搬进来的话也可以一起
交。)
6. 可以。我很乐意这么做。我喜欢自己买菜自己做饭。

Cook by oneself: 做饭的时候必须自己一个人，身边不能有别人(you have to cook
with no one else around, or no one helping you.)

housework each week.

8. 你和我说要我现在房东的推荐信。这是他的推荐信。他还说我按时交租，房间也保
持得很干净。
(You asked for the current landlord’s recommendation letter and here it is. The landlord
said I paid my rent on time and kept the room very clean.)
9. Thank you. It is important for me to make sure that you are a good tenant. Are there
any other questions that you want to ask?
(谢谢你。确认一下你是个好租客对我来说很重要。你还有别的想问的吗？)
10. 我想问一下你这里有停车位吗？我想走路去上班，把车停在家里。
(I wonder if you have any parking spaces here. I’d like to walk to work and leave my car
at home. )
11. There are 2 parking slots in the garage. I use one, and Steve doesn't have a car. So,
you can use the other one.
(车库里有两个停车位。我用一个。史蒂夫没有车。所以你可以用另一个车位。)
