#70159. A Lonely Transfer Student - Education
Briefing: The following dialogue happens between an English-speaking social worker
and a Mandarin-speaking client. The client's daughter is having some trouble at school.
The conversation takes place at the social worker's office. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Hi, thank you for coming to see me. I understand you want to talk about your
daughter at her new school, right?
（你好，谢谢你来见我。我知道你想谈谈你女儿在新学校的情况，对吗？）
2.
很高兴您给我打电话。我一直想约您见面谈这件事。
(I'm glad you called me. I've been wanting to meet with you to discuss this.)
3.
I know you changed a school for your daughter. That's good for her. But it sounds
like she has some new problems.
（我知道你给你女儿换了学校，这对她来说是件好事。不过听起来她似乎遇到了一
些新问题。）
4.
是的，转学之后她的成绩提高了不少。但是在社交方面有些困难。她没交到什么朋
友。
(Yes, her grades have improved a lot since the transfer. But she's having some trouble
socially. She hasn't made any friends.)
5.
It's good that her marks improved. That's a positive sign. She may just need more
time to settle in and make friends.
（她的成绩有提高，这是个好兆头。她可能只是需要更多时间来适应和交朋友。）
6.
可能吧。我有点担心她。她不怎么说话，但是我觉得她很孤独。我不想她的成绩再
下降。
(Maybe. I'm a bit worried about her. She doesn't talk much, but I think she's feeling
lonely. I don't want her grades to drop again.)

7.
Maybe some after-school activities will help. Is she interested in anything?
（也许一些课外活动会有所帮助。她对什么感兴趣吗？）
8.
她以前参加团体运动，但是后来，她之前的学校发生了霸凌事件，她就放弃了。她
还挺擅长运动的。
(She used to participate in team sports, but she quit after a bullying incident at her old
school. She's quite good at sports.)
9.
Team sports can be a good opportunity to get to know more classmates. Does the
school have any teams?
(团体运动是认识更多同学的好机会。学校有什么校队吗？)
10. 有。我想应该有篮球队和足球队。她在以前的学校经常踢足球。
(Yes. I think they have a basketball and a football team. She used to play football a lot at
her previous school.)
11. That's great! She should be able to join without any problems if she played football
before.
(太好了！如果她以前踢过足球，加入应该没问题的。)
12. 她马上放学回家了。我会和她聊一聊，让她去试一下。
(She's coming home from school soon. I'll talk to her and encourage her to give it a try.)
13. Encourage her to try. It's something extra for her to do. I think it may help.
(鼓励她试一试吧。这给她增加了一些额外的事情去做。我觉得这可能会有帮助。)
14. 同意。之前我不知道能为她做些什么。但是和您交流感觉很有帮助。谢谢您。
(I agree. I didn't know what I could do for her before but talking with you has been very
helpful. Thank you.)

#70160. Rental Inquiry at the Council Office - Business
Briefing:
The
following
dialogue
happens
at
the
Council
Office
between
an
English-speaking Council Officer and a Mandarin-speaking newly arrived migrant who
wants to rent a property. The dialogue starts now.
1. Good morning. Welcome to the Council Office. Please tell me how I can help you
today.
（早上好，欢迎来到市政厅办公室。请告诉我今天我能如何帮助您。）
2. 上午好，我想要了解更多关于租房的信息。我想要住在这个地区，这里看起来是个
很好的地方。
(Good morning. I would like to learn more about renting a property. I want to live in this
area; it seems like a great place.)
3. Yes, it is. People love to live here. There are many shops and restaurants in this area.
The parks are beautiful and very close to the beach.
（是的，这里确实如此。人们喜欢住在这里。这个地区有很多商店和餐馆，公园也
很美丽，非常靠近海滩。）
4. 太好了。我没想到这里的海滩这么棒，而且还这么近。我刚来到澳大利亚时间还不
长。目前为止，我见到的所有海滩都很棒。
(That’s great. I didn’t expect the beach here to be so wonderful and so close. I’ve only
recently arrived in Australia, and so far, all the beaches I’ve seen have been great.)
5. Welcome to Australia. I believe it would be challenging to move to a new country, as
many things are quite different.
（欢迎来到澳大利亚。我相信搬到一个新国家会很有挑战，因为许多事情都很不同。）

6. 是的，确实如此。很多事情都非常不同。如果能找到一个好的住所这会非常有帮助。
如果可能的话，我想要注册一个房子或者公寓。
(Yes, indeed. Many things are very different. It would be very helpful to find a good place
to live. If possible, I would like to register for a house or an apartment.)
7. I’m not sure if I understand what you mean by registering for a house or an
apartment.
（我不太明白您所说的“注册房屋或公寓”是什么意思。）
8. 在我原来的地方，市政办公室负责帮助我们注册房屋，把我们加入申请房屋的等待
名单中。
(In my previous place, the Council Office was responsible for helping us register for
housing and adding us to the waiting list for a property.)
9. I see. That’s totally different here. In general, the Council can’t provide rental
properties and can’t help people rent properties.
（我明白了。这在这里完全不同。通常情况下，市政办公室不能提供租赁房产，也
不能帮助人们租房。）
10. 哦，原来是这样。我不确定我现在能做些什么。我从来没有租过房子。
(Oh, I see. I’m not sure what I can do now; I have never rented a property before.)
11. Real estate agencies manage rental properties. You could start by talking with them
to find a suitable property.
（房地产中介负责管理租赁房产。你可以从跟他们谈谈开始，寻找合适的房子。）
12. 我在来的路上，看到了两家房屋中介。原来他们是负责这种工作的啊。
(I saw two real estate agencies on my way here. It turns out that they are responsible for
this kind of work.)

13. There are reviews of agents online. You could have a look, too.
（网上有对中介的评价，你也可以看看。）
14. 谢谢你的帮助。非常感谢你给我介绍了处理这件事的方法。我期待成为这个社区的
一员。
(Thank you for your help. Thank you very much for explaining how to deal with / handle
this matter / issue. I look forward to becoming a part of this community.)

#70161. Legal Consultation for Selling a Small Business –
Legal
Briefing: The following dialogue happens over the phone between an English-speaking
lawyer and a Mandarin-speaking small business owner who wants to sell her business
and is seeking legal advice. The dialogue starts now.
1. Good morning. Thanks for your call. How can I help you?
（早上好。感谢您的来电。我能怎么帮助您？）
2. 早上好。我需要咨询一些法律建议。我看到你们的网站上说，你们专门针对小生意
提供法律建议。
(Good morning. I need some legal advice. I saw on your website that you specialize in
providing legal advice for small businesses.)
3. Yes, that’s correct. We provide business owners with advice on commercial and
employment matters. Why do you need legal advice?
（是的，没错。我们给商家提供商业和雇佣方面的法律建议。您为什么需要法律建
议呢？）
4. 事情是这样的：我有一个小生意和三个雇员，但我现在想要卖掉这个生意。这是一
个很艰难的决定。
(Here is the thing: I have a small business with three employees, but I want to sell the
business now. It’s a tough decision.)
5. I see. I can help you with the legal aspects of selling your business, if you like.
However, you will need to handle the arrangements for the employees yourself.
（我明白了。如果您愿意，我可以帮助您处理出售生意的法律事务。然而，您需要
自己处理员工的安排。）

6. 谢谢。我需要您帮我起草卖生意的协议。我已经找到买家了，但我的组织能力不是
很好。
(Thank you. I need your help to draft the sales agreement. I have already found a buyer,
but my organizational skills are not very strong.)
7. Congratulations! I can help you draft the agreement. That won’t be a problem.
When you need to terminate the employment contracts, I can help with that as well.
（恭喜！我可以帮助您起草合同。没问题的。您需要终止员工合同的时候，我也可
以帮忙。）
8. 不，员工希望继续为新买家工作。买家已经同意了，我也希望他们都能有个好去处。
(No, the employees want to continue working for the new buyer. The buyer has agreed,
and I hope they all find a good place.)
9. That would be a good outcome for all of you. I will prepare a conditional sales
agreement, which will also provide legal protection for the employees.
（那对你们所有人来说都会是一个很好的结果。我会起草一份附带条件的出售协议，
让员工也能获得法律保护。）
10. 谢谢你，这样我就放心多了。我不喜欢因为遗漏一些部分，而导致预想不到的事情
发生。
(Thank you. This makes me feel much more relieved. I don't like unexpected things to
happen due to missing some parts / I don't like it when unexpected things happen because
of missing some parts.)
11. Yes, it’s always a wise decision to seek help from professionals, as drafting a sales
agreement involves many considerations.
（是的，寻求专业人士的帮助总是明智的决定，因为起草出售协议涉及许多需要考
虑的事项。）

12. 是的，我还有很多存货和设备，也需要包含在卖生意的协议里。
(Yes, I also have a lot of inventory and equipment that need to be included in the sales
agreement.)
13. Why don’t we schedule an appointment to organize the sales agreement? If it’s
urgent, I’m available at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
（我们约个时间来整理出售协议怎么样？如果事情紧急的话，我明天下午两点有空。）
14. 太好了！明天见，期待见到您以及开始弄协议。
(Great! See you tomorrow. I look forward to meeting you and getting started on/ start
working on the agreement.)

and her English-speaking British neighbor. They are discussing how to organize a
gathering to help everyone get to know the new neighbors better. The dialogue starts
now.

下。

with you.）

not sit down and have a chat with me?

4. 昨天，我遇到一位女士。她刚搬到我家对面。我突然意识到，我对住在这里的很多
人，都不太熟悉。
(Yesterday, I met a lady/woman who just moved in across from mine/my home. I
suddenly realized that I’m not very familiar with many people living here.)
5. Yes, you don’t say. Loads of new people have moved here over the past six months. I
don’t know them either.
（是啊，你说得对。过去六个月里有很多新搬过来的人，我也不认识他们。）

6. 下周末，我们找一个下午，举办一个聚会吧？这样可以有一个不错的机会，让大家
可以互相见见面，还可以吃点东西，喝点东西。
(How about we organize a gathering one afternoon next weekend? It would be a great
opportunity for everyone to meet, and we can have some snacks and drinks.)
7. It sounds fantastic. I think it won’t be too difficult to organize this gathering. We can
just do it casually. Let’s do it next weekend.
（听起来很棒！我觉得组织这个聚会不会太难。我们可以随意点。我们就下周末搞
吧。）
8. 好的。我想，现在最重要的事情是，我们可以告诉大家，那天下午有空了就可以来
参加。不需要太正式。
(Great. I think the most important thing now is to let everyone know that they’re welcome
to join that afternoon if they are free. It doesn’t need to be too formal.)
9. I still have the decorations from my last party. We can use them. I don’t think we
need music at the gathering. After all, our main goal is to chat and connect with each
other.
（我还有上次聚会的装饰品。我们可以用它们。我觉得聚会不需要音乐，毕竟我们
的主要目的是聊天和互相认识。）
10. 没错。最重要的事情是让大家知道聚会即将举行。我们要尽快发邀请函。
(Exactly. The most important thing is to let everyone know that the gathering is coming
up/about to take place. We should send out the invitations as soon as possible.)
11. That sounds really exciting! Once the invitations are ready, do let me know. I'll help
you deliver them to everyone. And if I run into them, I'll be sure to mention it as well.
（听起来真令人激动！一旦邀请函准备好了，记得告诉我。我帮你发给大家。如果
我遇到他们，我也会告诉他们这件事的。）
