#70152. Foot Injury Consultation- Medical
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking Doctor and a
Mandarin-speaking Patient. The patient has a foot injury and comes to the doctor's
clinic. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Good morning, I haven't seen you for a long time. What can I do for you today?
（早上好，有段时间没看到你了。今天我能帮你做些什么？）
2.
你好医生，我的脚受伤了，我认为我最好是来找你看一下。
（Hello, doctor. My foot got injured and I thought it would be best to come see you.）
3.
Oh dear, that's not good. I'm glad you can come to see me about it. How did the
injury happen?
(天哪，那可不太好。我很高兴你能来见我。怎么受伤的？)
4.
我周六在公园做体育活动。我摔倒了。摔倒的角度很不好。
（I was doing sports activities in the park on Saturday, and I fell. The angle of the fall
was very bad.）
5.
That's a common injury in sports. Can you tell me what kind of pain you are
experiencing and what treatment you have done since the injury?
（这是运动中常见的伤。你能告诉我：你感觉到的是哪种疼痛，还有受伤后你做了
什么治疗吗？）
6.
我摔倒的时候不疼，几分钟之后我站了起来，继续比赛。
（It didn't hurt when I fell, and a few minutes later I got up and continued the game.）
7.
I understand. Generally, it is not a good idea to keep playing if you hurt yourself,
even if it's not that painful.
（我明白。通常，如果你受伤了，即使不太疼，继续比赛也不是个好主意。）

我确实想停下来的，但是比赛马上就要结束了。我在回家之后做了冰敷。
（I did want to stop, but the game was about to end. I iced my foot after I got home.）
9.
It has been 4 days since you were injured. Do you think your condition has gotten
better with rest and applying ice?
（你受伤已经4 天了。你觉得休息和冰敷后情况有好转吗？）
10. 不，我觉得没有，每天情况都在恶化，所以我决定到你这来找你看一下。
（No, I don't think so. It's getting worse every day, so I decided to come see you.）
11. I will send you to the hospital for an X-ray to see exactly how your foot is injured
and how to treat it.
（我会送你去医院做X 光检查，看看你的脚到底是怎么受伤的，以及该怎么治疗。）
12. 哦，我不想去医院。你能在你的诊所里给我检查么？在这我觉得更舒服。
（Oh, I don't want to go to the hospital. Can you examine me here in your clinic? I feel
more comfortable here.）
13. Unfortunately, no, but don't worry. The hospital staff will take care of you during
and after the X-ray.
（很遗憾不行，但是别担心，医院的工作人员会在你做X 光时还有做完X 光后照顾
你的。）
15. 好吧，我会尽快去医院的。希望不会花太长时间，这样我们就能知道我的脚怎么样
了。
（Alright, I will go to the hospital as soon as possible. Hopefully, it won't take too long
so we can find out what's wrong with my foot.）

Good morning, thank you for calling. This is Mike speaking. How can I help you
today?

2.
你好，我打电话是来问你们的太阳能板系统的，昨天我在网上看到广告说在打折。
（Hello, I'm calling to ask about your solar panel systems. I saw an advertisement online

You don’t have to buy batteries. You can still get the benefits of solar power during
the day with just the panels.
（你不需要买电池。只用太阳能板就能在白天享受太阳能的好处。）
8.
那我能问一下哪些太阳能板系统在打折么？这些太阳能板的价格的确都很好。我希
望它们的质量也不错。
（May I ask which solar panel systems are on discount then? The prices of these solar
panels are indeed very good. I hope the quality is also good.）
9.
Yes, they are. This solar panel has been on the market for 10 years, and it has both a
warranty and a good track record.
（是的。这款太阳能板已经在市场上销售10 年了，有保修，信誉好。）
10. 很高兴知道这个。这么多年没什么大问题，那质量肯定也不错。
（I'm glad to know that. If there haven't been any major issues for so many years, then
the quality must be good.）
11. We are proud to provide our customers with high-quality solar panel systems, with
or without batteries. Our team has great experience in installing them.
（我们很自豪能为客户提供高质量的太阳能板系统，不管它们带不带电池。我们的

么呢？
（I'm glad to hear that. I think this system is suitable for me and the price is affordable.
So, what should I do next?）

Hi, this is Kate. How may I help you today?
（您好，我是凯特。我今天能如何帮到您？）
2.
您好，我想了解一下怎样在你们银行申请房贷，我打算买房。我不知道怎么做。
(Hi, I'd like to know how to apply for a mortgage at your bank. I'm planning to buy
a
house, and I don't know how to proceed.)
3.
That’s very exciting. I am happy to help you. Are you a customer of our bank?
（这真是太令人兴奋了。我很乐意帮助您。您是我们银行的客户吗？）
4.
是的，我在你们银行已经开户5 年了，我一直对你们的服务很满意。
(Yes, I've had an account with your bank for 5 years, and I've always been very
satisfied with your services.)
5.
That’s great. That will make the application easier. Although it will still take some
time. It could be a problem if you have already got your eye on a property.
（太好了。这会让申请变得容易。虽然说还是得需要些时间。如果您已经看上一个
房子的话，可能是个问题。）
6.
没，我刚开始一份新的工作，薪水比之前高很多。我现在能支付得起房屋贷款了。
所以我想开始找房子，现在申请房屋贷款。

7.
That’s a very good idea. You can apply for our home loan online through our
website or go to a branch loan officer.
（这是个很好的主意。您可以通过我们的网站在线申请房屋贷款，或者可以去找我
们分行的贷款专员。）
8.
好的，我知道我需要身份证明文件来开户，我带了护照和驾照，我还需要其他什么
文件吗？
(Okay, I know I need identification documents to open an account. I have my passport
and driver's license with me. Do I need any other documents?)
9.
Yes, you will need to provide proof of income, such as payslips or an employment
contract. You also need to provide details regarding your assets and liabilities.
（是的，您需要提供您的收入证明，例如工资单或雇佣合同。您还需要提供关于您
资产和负债的详细信息。)
11. 我不确定我是否有资产，我有一辆车，还有在你们银行有储蓄账户，我信用卡账户
里面没有多少欠款，只有400 块。
(I'm not sure if I have assets. I have a car and a savings account with your bank. My
credit card account doesn't have much debt, only 400 dollars.)
11. Yes, our bank will consider your car and your savings as your assets. You may be
eligible for some benefits because this is your first time purchasing a home.
（是的，我们银行会把您的车和存款视为您的资产。由于这是您第一次置业，您可
能有资格享受一些优惠。）
12. 我之前都不知道这些啊。也许我应该直接去你们当地的分行找贷款专员谈谈，而不
是在网上申请。这样可能会更简单。
(I didn't know any of this before. Maybe I should go directly to your local branch and
talk to a loan officer instead of applying online. That might be simpler.)
13. Of course. You can just call your local branch and make an appointment.
