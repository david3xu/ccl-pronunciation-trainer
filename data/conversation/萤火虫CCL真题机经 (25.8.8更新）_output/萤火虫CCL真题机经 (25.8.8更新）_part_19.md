#70051. Family migration - Immigration
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking migration
agent and a mandarin speaking woman, who is enquiring about helping her mother and
sister migrate to Australia. The dialogue starts now.
1.
下午好，我想问一下关于申请我母亲和姐姐来澳洲的相关信息。
(Good afternoon. I want to make an enquiry about my mother and my elder sister’s
coming to Australia.)
2.
Good afternoon. Could you please tell me some information about your family?
(下午好。您能跟我说下您家里的情况吗？)
3.
好的。我现在是澳大利亚永久居民，我丈夫是澳大利亚公民。我听说像我这样的情
况，给我家人办移民很容易，是吗？
(Okay. I’m a permanent resident of Australia and my husband is a citizen. I heard that in
our case, it’s easy for my family to immigrate here, is that right?)
4.
Family reunion in Australia can be complicated and expensive, which you may
know already. How old is your mother?
(您也许已经知道了，澳大利亚的家庭团聚移民会比较复杂，而且费用很高。您母亲
多大年龄呢？)
5.
我母亲结婚早，所以她现在也才40 多岁。我丈夫也想尽力让我妈妈和姐姐过来。
(My mother got married young, so she's only in her early 40s now. My husband also
wants to do everything he can to bring my mother and sister over.)
6.
I see. What is the relationship between your husband and your mother like?
(我知道了。您丈夫和您的母亲关系怎么样？)
7.
我丈夫跟我家人之前在海外见过的，他们相处得很愉快的。

(My husband has met with my family overseas before, and they got along.)
8.
Okay, the reason I asked is that the Australian Federal government is worried that
old immigrants may become a burden. In other words, the government would like to
make sure that the parent visa won’t result in too much burden on the welfare
system.
(好的。我这么问的原因是，澳大利亚联邦政府担心，年迈的移民会成为一个负担。
换句话讲，政府想要确保，父母签证不会给福利系统带来过重的负担。)
9.
不会的，我母亲很健康，之前连说服她搬到这边都很难的。只要她在这边安顿下来，
我们就会照顾她, 为她提供经济担保。
(It won’t happen to us. My mother is quite healthy. It was even difficult to persuade her
to move here. We’ll take care of her and give her an Assurance of Support, as long as she
settles down here.)

10. Okay, then you should apply as soon as possible, as the application may take as long
as 20 years due to the long waiting time. Also, they’ll have to pass the character test
and go through an identification check.
(好的，那你要尽快申请了，因为要等很久，申请可能得耗时长达20 年。另外，他
们必须通过品格测试，以及完成身份核查。)

11. 为什么要进行品格测试呢？她们都是品格非常好的女性啊。
(What’s the character test for? They are all women with perfect character.)
12. It’s mainly for security reasons. Applicants may need to provide an overseas penal
clearance certificate from each country they have visited. You can get this done at
the embassy.
(这主要是出于安全原因。申请人要提供他们去过所有国家的海外无犯罪记录证明。
你可以去大使馆开具证明。)

13. 好的。听起来很复杂，很费时间啊。
(Okay. It sounds quite complicated and time-consuming.)
14. There’s also a permanent contributory parent visa, which is processed within 4-5
years. The total cost is over $40,000 for each parent. And they need to provide the
Department of Home Affairs with files like their birth certificates and so on. So, the
cost may grow.
(还有一个付费类父母移民签证，四到五年的时间就可以完成申请。总共费用是父母
每人四万多澳币。你的父母还需要向内政事务部提供一些文件，比如出生证明等。
所以，费用可能还会再涨。)

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking insurance

Hello! Thank you for holding. I’m very sorry for the delay! How may I help you
today?
(您好，感谢您的等待。很抱歉让您久等。我今天能怎么帮到您呢？)

你好，我们前几天发生了交通事故，车子撞的很严重。幸好没有人受伤。我想要申
请索赔。
(Hi. We had a traffic accident several days ago. The car has been severely damaged.
Luckily, no one was injured. I’d like to make a claim.)
3.
I’m sorry to hear that. As you said，thankfully, no one was injured, it seems that you
have hit an animal. When did the accident happen?
(听到这个我深表遗憾。您说幸好没人受伤，那听上去好像是您撞到了动物。是什么
时候的事呢？)
4.
是的。我感觉应该撞到了一只大袋鼠。时间是大概晚上十点。我根本没看见它，不
知道它从什么地方突然跳出来了。我们听到“砰！”的一声。我们都吓坏了.
(Right. I felt that the car must have hit a big kangaroo. It was around 10 o’clock in the
evening and I hadn’t seen it at all. Out of nowhere, it suddenly jumped out. We heard a
loud bang and we were terrified.)

Well, many animals become roadkill in Australia. You must have heard of that
happening often.
(嗯，在澳大利亚，很多动物都在路上被轧死了。您一定也总听说吧！)

Roadkill: 不可数名词：路上被轧死的动物。
6.
是的，我听说过。但是我们的损失也很严重啊！我的车子侧面和前面都凹进去了，
前挡风玻璃也碎了。
(Yes, I’ve heard of that. But we have also suffered a great loss. The side and front of my
car were dented, and the front windshield was broken.)
7.
I’m sorry to hear that. It is stated in a specific clause of the policy that the insurance
doesn’t cover damage caused by animals, accidents that take place outside the city
region or after dark. Where did the accident happen?
(听到这个我很抱歉。保险单里专门有一项条款是，您的保险不报销动物造成的损失，
不报销发生在市区外的事故，也不报销天黑以后发生的事故。您是在哪里出的事
呢？)
8.
当然是发生在市区外了！你在市区马路上看到过袋鼠跳来跳去吗？！
(Of course it took place outside the city region! Have you ever seen kangaroos jumping
around on a city road?)
9.
Well, you’ll be surprised where you can find kangaroos in Australia.
(这个嘛，在澳大利亚，能发现袋鼠的地方是让人惊喜的。)
10. 我才不想要什么惊喜呢！我就想要修车的钱。修这个车需要好几千块钱呢！你的意
思是说你们不给赔偿吗？
(Surprise is the last thing I want. I just want the money to repair the car. It costs
thousands of dollars to repair it! Do you mean that the payout is impossible/off the table?)

10. 我也不清楚。我们到现在为止没有签过合同，也没有见过任何书面材料。这就是我
担心的原因。
(I’m not sure. We haven’t signed any contracts, nor have we seen any printed documents.
That’s why I’m worried.)
11. Um…that doesn’t sound good. You have been working in Australia for a while，so
you should have some ideas about fair and reasonable work payment.
(嗯…这听上去可不太好啊。你们已经在澳大利亚工作一阵子了，所以什么样的工资
报酬是公平合理的，你本该有些了解的。)
12. 我那时候也不知道我拿不到工资啊！请你帮帮我们吧！
(At that time, I didn’t know that I wouldn’t get paid. Please help us!)
13. We can register you and provide you with assistance. However, we will need more
information to help determine what your hourly rate should be. We also need the
name of the company, its location and ABN.

them out. Thank you for your help.)
15. You’re welcome. I still need you to fill out some forms and get back to me.
