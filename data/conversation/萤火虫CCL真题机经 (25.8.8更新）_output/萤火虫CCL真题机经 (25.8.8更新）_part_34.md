#70102. Parking Rules - Legal
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking staff and
her English-speaking co-worker. They are discussing the parking rules in the local area.
The dialogue starts now.
1. Hello, it’s nice to meet you. How are you today?
(你好，见到你很开心。你今天怎么样？)
2. 我还好，就是有点累。因为我需要坐公交车来上班。
(I’m okay. It’s just I’m a bit tired because I have to take a bus to work.)
3. Well, why not drive to work? It can be much easier if you drive. The traffic here is
not too bad.
(嗯，为什么不开车上班呢？这样会轻松的多。这儿的交通不算太差。)
4. 我想开车的。但我不知道哪里可以停车。我完全不知道。我不想抽到罚单。
(I do want to drive, but I don’t know where to park. I have no idea at all. I don’t want to
get a ticket.)
5. I understand. The traffic rules are strict here and the fine is very expensive.
(我懂的。这儿的交通规则太严了，罚款也很高。)
6. 我不知道那些停车位可以停两个小时，还是一整天。那些停车标志太让人迷惑了。
(I don’t know whether I’m allowed to park for two hours or a whole day in these parking
spaces, and these parking signs are too confusing.)
7. The time is on the sign. There’re some all-day parking spaces next street, if you don’t
mind a 10-minute walk.
(停车时间都写在标志上了。如果你不介意走个十分钟，隔壁街上有一些车位是可以
停一整天的。)

8. 我不知道啊。我不介意的。我上夜班，每两个小时要移一次车。没有什么能比这个
更糟糕的了。
(I had no idea. I don’t really mind that. I’m working night shift and I have to move my
car every two hours. There’s nothing worse than that.)
9. I didn’t realize you are taking night shift. The parking legislation will not apply at
night. You can park anywhere you want and as long as you want.
(我不知道你要上夜班。停车规则到了晚上是不适用的。你可以随便停，停多久都行
的。)
10. 我以为那些规则是一整天都一样的。如果是这样，我上夜班就更好了。我以为在这
个时段开车来上班是有点蠢呢。
(I thought those rules applied throughout the day. If that’s the case, working night shift
sounds even better. I think it was silly to drive to work during that time period.)
11. If you park after 4pm, you can stay until 9’o clock next morning. At least you know
now.
(如果你下午四点以后停车，你可以一直停到第二天早上九点。起码你现在知道啦。)
12. 是啊，谢谢你。因为罚金很高，我之前每天都要提早一小时起床赶公交车。
(Yes, I do now. Thank you. I had to get up one hour earlier every day to catch the bus
because the fine is so expensive.)
13. Well, now you’re able to enjoy one hour of extra sleep now. That legislation will only
be effective on weekdays from 9am to 6pm.
(嗯，现在你每天可以多享受一个小时的睡眠了。那条规则只有工作日早九点到晚六
点之间才有效的。)
14. 好的。我很高兴跟你聊天。我还没有适应在这里的生活。这里的规矩很不一样。
(Okay. Great chatting with you! I’m still adjusting to my life here. Rules here can be

1. Good morning. This is Marion speaking. How can I help you today?
(早上好，我是马里恩。我今天能如何帮到您呢？)
2. 你好，马里恩。我刚刚租了个房子。我朋友告诉我，应该给我的财物买保险。
(Hello, Marion. I just rented a house and my friend told me that I should take out
insurance for the contents inside/for my belongings. )
3. That’s a good idea. It sounds like you need to get a contents insurance policy. I’m
glad to provide you with all the information you need.
(这是个好主意。听上去您要选住宅内物品险的保单。我很愿意为您提供所有您需要
的信息。)
4. 谢谢你，马里恩。这个保险能保什么呢？
(Thank you, Marion. What does this insurance cover?)
5. It can cover your contents in the house, such as your furniture, appliances, clothes,
jewelry, musical instruments and so on.
(这个保险可以保你房子里的东西，比如你的家具，家电，衣服，珠宝，乐器，等等。)
6. 听起来真不错。请告诉我它是怎么操作的吧。我真是不太清楚。我有些很贵的家具，
一台电视，几幅油画，和别的一些东西。
(That sounds really great. I’d like to know how it works. I really have no idea of it. I have
some expensive furniture, a TV, several oil paintings and some other stuff.)
7. It can cover the fees to replace or repair your contents if they are stolen, lost or

damaged.
(如果您的财物被偷了，丢了或者坏了，这份保险可以帮您支付置换或者修理财物的
费用。)
8. 这很适合我啊，我住在一个火灾高危区。万一发生了森林火灾，我的一切就付诸东
流了。
(That really suits me. I live in a fire prone area. Everything will be gone if a bushfire
happens.)
9. In that case, it’s very important to buy insurance. It will be really costly to replace all
your belongings.
(那样的话，买保险就非常重要了。您置换所有的东西真的会非常贵的。)
10. 我朋友跟我说，我应该买水灾险，我不知道这个是不是包括在财物保险里的。
(My friend said I should buy flood insurance purchase / take out flood insurance. I don’t
know if that’s included in contents insurance.)
11. Not always, but you can ask for it if you want.
(不一定的。但是如果您需要，您可以提出来的。)
12. 我想在你们这里买财物保险，包括水灾险，以防万一。
(I’d like to buy contents insurance from you, including flood insurance, just in case.)
13. Ok, the first thing you need to do is calculating the value of the items in your house.
(好的，您首先需要做的就是算一下房子里物品的价值。)
14. 我有一些特殊的物品，比如油画，我知道它们的价值。但是我不太确定全部物品的
价值。
(I have some special items, such as oil paintings. I know their value. But for the value of
all the items, I can’t say for sure. )

15. I can transfer you to another department and there will be someone to help you with
that. Once you know the value, you can choose the right policy.
(我可以把您转到另一个部门，那边会有人帮您处理这个问题的。等您知道物品的价
值了，您就可以选合适的保单了。)
16. 谢谢你，马里恩。非常感谢你的帮助。
(Thank you, Marion. I really appreciate your help.)

#70104. Hanging branches- Legal
Briefing ：
The
following
dialogue
takes
place
over
the
phone,
between
a
Mandarin-speaking local resident and an English-speaking council worker. They are
discussing some legal issues regarding the resident’s neighbor’s hanging branches. The
dialogue starts now.
1. Hello, my name is Sally, Sorry to keep you waiting. It’s quite a busy morning here.
(你好，我是莎丽。抱歉让你久等了。我们今天早上太忙了。)
2. 没事，我看你也挺忙的，我只是想问一下关于我邻居悬挂树枝的问题。
(It’s okay. I see you are quite busy. I just want to ask about my neighbor’s hanging
branches. )
3. Oh, I see. It is quite common in this area. Is the tree on your neighbour’s garden or
on a public land?
(噢，我知道了。这在这个区很常见的。树是在你邻居的花园里，还是在公共区域呢？)
4. 树枝从我邻居家院子里，长到我的后花园里来了，好多树叶都掉到我的游泳池去了，
我经常要清理它。
(The branches grow from my neighbor’s yard to my back garden. Many leaves fall into
my swimming pool and I have to clean it frequently.)
5. I understand, if the tree is in a public land, then we can arrange a council worker to
help you trim it. However, this seems like a private matter between you and your
neighbor.
(我理解。如果树长在公共区域，我们可以安排市政厅的工人帮您修剪。但是，这好
像是您跟您邻居的私事。)
6. 我挺愿意自己去把它修剪一下。不知道我是否能够有资格做这个事情？我不想和我
邻居产生法律纠纷。
(I’m happy to trim it by myself. I’m not sure if I’m eligible to do it. I don’t want to have

any legal disputes with my neighbor.)
7. You are allowed to trim branches that have approached your private residence.
However, we suggest that you talk with your neighbor first and discuss a solution.
(如果是靠近私人住宅的树枝，您是可以修剪的。但是，我们建议您先跟您的邻居谈
谈，商量好一个解决方法。)
8. 好的。我今天晚上回去试着和她聊一下。我邻居可能也想去修剪一下她那边的树枝。
(Okay. I’ll try talking with my neighbor first after I’m home tonight. She probably also
wants to trim the branches on her side.)
9. That is a very good plan. You might want to also write a letter. Having a written
letter with detail can help you avoid some misunderstandings.
(这个方案很好。您或许还可以给她写封信。一封详细的手写信能帮您避免掉一些误
会。)
10. 是的，我相信我们能礼貌的解决这个问题的。这棵树很美，我也不想修剪太多, 破坏
了它。
(Yes. I believe we could solve this in a polite way. This tree is beautiful, and I don’t want
to ruin it by trimming too much of it. )
11. Don’t worry, I think there is a chance to reach a good solution. If not, you could
resolve this with the help of a mediator.
(别担心。我觉得你们是有可能好好解决这件事的。如果不行的话，你们可以找调解
员帮忙解决。)
12. 我希望不会发展到那个方向。我希望我们能冷静处理这件事。莎莉，谢谢你的帮助。
(I hope it won’t come to that. Hopefully we could handle this calmly. Thank you for your
help, Sally.)

#70105. Pay off credit card balance – Business
Briefing ：The following dialogue takes place between Peter, an English-speaking
financial adviser and a Mandarin-speaking client, who needs some financial advice. The
dialogue starts now.
1. Hello! Please come in. My name is Peter. It’s nice to meet you.
(你好！请进吧。我叫彼得。很高兴见到你。)
2. 你好，彼得。我也很高兴见到你。很开心你可以和我见面。我需要一些经济上的建
议。
(Hello, Peter. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m glad that you could meet me. I need some
financial advice. )
3. Okay. I understand that the reason your loan officer of the bank referred you to my
office is that you missed your mortgage payment.
(好的。我知道你银行的贷款专员把你转到我的办公室，是因为你没还上抵押贷款。)
4. 对的。我最近付房贷有些困难。我不会管理我的开支，付账单对我来说也很困难。
(Yes. I have been having difficulty paying my home loan. I’m not able to manage my
expenses and it’s hard for me to pay my bills. )
【萤火虫老师Tips】

固定搭配中，不可以说“have difficulty TO DO sth ❌”, 正确的搭配是“have
difficulty (in) DOING sth”;

Spending 往往指政府或者机构的开支，而不是个人的。
5. The first thing we need to do is to track your expenses and set a budget. This will be
helpful for you to manage your money every month.
(我们首先需要先追踪你的开支，并且要建立一个预算。这会帮你管好每个月的钱。)

6. 那太好了。到了月底我就没有钱了。我只能用信用卡来买杂货。我的负债就越来越
多。
(That’s great. I don’t have any money at the end of the month, and I have to use my credit
card to buy groceries. My debt just piles up. )
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Debt 用来指“负债”“债务”时，通常用单数形式。如果欠债不止一笔时，或者强
调“所有的债务”时，则用复数debts.
7. Many of my clients have the same problem with their credit cards. The interest rate
is so high and it’s difficult to pay off the credit card balance.
(我有很多客户，也是在信用卡上有同样的问题：利率非常高，很难还清信用卡欠款。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Balance 在这里指“欠款”，而不是余额。
8. 对啊！我太恐慌了！我尝试着每个月付一点，但是好像还是一点用也没有。
(Yes! I’m so panicked. I tried paying a little bit every month, but seemed it didn’t work at
all.)
9. I understand that this can be overwhelming. Setting a budget will definitely be
helpful. I can also help you transfer your credit card balance to another card with a
lower interest rate.
(我能理解这会让你觉得应付不过来。建立预算肯定是有帮助的。我可以帮你把信用
卡欠款转到另一张利率低的卡上。)
10. 我不知道还可以这样做！如果利率可以更低的话，付清我的信用卡欠款就会很容易
了。
(I didn’t know you could do that! If the interest rate could be lower, it would be quite
easy to pay off my credit card balance. )
