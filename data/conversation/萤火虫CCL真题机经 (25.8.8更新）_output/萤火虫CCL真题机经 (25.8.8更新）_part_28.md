#70081. Opening a bank account - Business
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Jane, an English-speaking bank
teller and a Mandarin-speaking client who wants to open a new account. The dialogue
starts now.
1. Hi, I am Jane. What can I do for you today?
(您好，我是简。今天我能为您做些什么呢？)
2. 你好, 简。我最近刚开始一份全职工作。我想开一个新的银行账户。
(Hello, John. I’ve recently started a full-time job and I’d like to open a new bank
account.)
3. Well, I’m more than happy to help you with that. There are some people who open
an account for automatic transactions so it’s more convenient for them to pay their
bills; and there are some people who open an account for saving money.
(嗯，这个我很乐意为您效劳。有些人开户是用来自动转账的，这样他们支付账单就
更方便了。而有些人开户是用来存钱的。)
4. 我想要开一个储蓄账户，这样我就可以存钱买物业了。我已经有一个支付账户了。
(I’d like to open a savings account so that I can save (up) for a property/save money to
buy a property. I already have a debit account.)
5. That’s good to hear. It will be much easier to apply for a home loan from a bank if
you already have a savings account.
(那很好。如果您已经有储蓄账户了，跟银行申请房贷就容易得多了。)
6. 那太好啦。能找到全职工作真的很好，这样我就能存更多的钱了。
(That’s good. It’s great that I’ve found a full-time job so that I can save more money.)

7. You may choose to deposit money weekly or monthly after you open a savings
account. The amount of your interest will depend on how much you deposit.
(在您开了存款账户以后，您可以选择按周存，或者按月存。您能拿多少利息，要看
您存多少钱。)
8. 好的，那对我来说，最简单的方法就是每个月存一次钱啦，因为我每个月发一次工
资。我可以选择存款数额吗？
(Okay. The easiest way for me is to deposit money every month because I get paid
monthly. Do I get to decide the amount deposited?)
9. Well, you have to make a minimum deposit of $200 every month. There’s no
maximum limit though.
(这个嘛，每个月您最少得存200 澳币，不过没有上限。)
10. 200 澳币可以的。我肯定能存200 澳币以上的。
($200 is acceptable. I’ll definitely deposit more than $200. )
11. That’s great. Apart from that, you can withdraw money monthly without having to
pay any fees.
(那很好。另外呢，您还可以每个月取钱，这个是不会额外收费的。)
12. 太好啦。我应该不会取钱的。你能告诉我要怎么开户吗？我已经把身份文件都带来
了。
(That’s great. I don’t think I’ll withdraw money. Could you explain to me how to open an
account? I’ve already got my identity documents here.)
13. That’s great. I just need your identity documents since you have already had an
account with us. I will help you open a new account now.
(那很好。因为您已经在我们这开过户了，您把身份文件给我就可以了。我现在就帮
您开新账户。)

soon as possible.)

1. Good morning! I’m Anni and I’m a real estate agent. Have you already looked
around at the apartment?
(早上好，我是安妮，我是一名房产中介。您已经看过这个公寓了吗？)
2. 你好，安妮。我已经看过公寓了。这个公寓真好啊！我有些问题想问您。

some questions for you.)
3. Sure. May I ask what you’d like to know?
(当然可以了。请问您想了解些什么呢？)
4. 我注意到洗衣房里有一台洗衣机。这套公寓里面有洗衣机吗？我是没有洗衣机的。
如果公寓里有，就太方便啦。
(I noticed that there’s a washing machine in the laundry. Is there a washing machine in
this apartment? I don’t have one. It would be quite convenient if the apartment comes
with one. )
5. Yes, this apartment comes with a washing machine. It will be very convenient. You
don’t need to buy one for yourself.
(是的，这套公寓里是带洗衣机的。这就非常方便了。您不用自己买洗衣机了。)
6. 那太好啦。我在来的时候，我看到别的公寓里有只小狗。请问这个公寓可以养狗吗？
(That’s great. On my way here, I saw a puppy/little dog in another apartment. May I ask
if I can have a dog in the apartment? )

7. Yes, there’re some rules though. You also need to get permission from the owner.
Keeping large animals is not allowed. But usually a small animal such as a kitten or a
puppy is acceptable.
(可以的。不过您要遵守一些规定。您还要得到房主的允许。养大型动物是不行的。
不过通常来说，像小猫小狗这样的小动物是可以的。)
8. 我自己没有狗，但是我确实想买一只。租客要能在公寓里养小狗，真的是太棒了。
(I don’t have a dog. However, I do want to buy one. It would be great if tenants are
allowed to have puppies in their apartments.)
9. Some tenants do have small pets. They fill the apartment building with happiness for
everyone.
(有些租客确实养了小宠物。它们让这个公寓楼里的每个人都感觉到了满满的开心/
感觉到非常开心。)
10. 太好啦。我在你们的网站上看到了租房申请表。我已经填完了。我觉得应该没什么
问题。
(That’s great. I saw a rental application form on your website and I have already filled it
out. I think there should be no problem.)
11. It certainly won’t be a problem. Your application is the first one I have received
regarding this apartment. Let me check the relevant details…yes, everything is good.
There should be no problem.
(当然没问题的。您的申请是我收到的关于这个公寓的第一份申请。让我来看看相关
的细节信息…嗯，都很好。应该没问题的。)
12. 谢谢你！我填表的时候特别小心，因为英语不是我的第一语言。如果申请成功了，
我希望我能尽早知道啦。
(Thank you! I was very careful when I was filling out the form, because English is not
my first language. I hope I could know as soon as possible if the application is
successful. )

English, accent should not be a problem.

什么问题的。)

(Okay，I also want to know how long it takes to complete this course and how much the
tuition fee is.)

shows how it works.
