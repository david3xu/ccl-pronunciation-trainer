失。

不过，这种保险不会覆盖已经存在的疾病（A pre-existing condition ：既往病），
只能保买保险之后新发生的病。

它和医疗保险不同，医疗保险报销的是治疗费用，而创伤保险直接给一笔钱，
怎么用都可以。
5. Sure! We’re more than happy to help with that. I’d be happy to answer all your
questions, and I can also give you a quote based on your needs.
（当然！我们很乐意帮忙。我可以解答你的所有问题，也可以根据你的需求给你一
个报价。）
6. 谢谢你！我想知道创伤保险是不是谁都能买？有没有什么限制？
(Thanks! I’d like to know—can anyone purchase trauma insurance, or are there any
restrictions?)
7. Well, trauma insurance generally excludes pre-existing conditions. So, if you already
have any pre-existing conditions covered by your current policy, that particular
condition won’t be covered under trauma insurance.
（嗯，创伤保险一般不保既往病。所以，如果你有什么既往病，现保单也承保，那
创伤保险里不会赔付的。）
【萤火虫老师Tips】

A pre-existing condition：既往病。保险行业的专业说法（这里“既往病”的英文地
道说法不用“disease”。）

从保险产品的逻辑上讲，创伤保险通常是用来保障因突发健康事件而产生的风
险，而不是为已经存在的健康问题（既往病）提供赔付。也就是说，保险公司
通常会规定：如果你已有某种健康状况（被视为既往病），那么这种状况不会
纳入创伤保险的保障范围。比如患有心脏病、哮喘等慢性病的情况。在保险之
前怀孕通常也属于Pre-existing conditions。

8. 有道理。我现在没有健康问题。但是以后的事情谁知道呢？这个保险能覆盖所有的
疾病吗？
(That makes sense. I don’t have any health issues right now, but who knows what could
happen in the future? Does this insurance cover all illnesses?)
9. Trauma insurance coverage is similar to that of other critical illness policies. It
usually includes six major categories, such as heart attacks.
（创伤保险的保障范围和其他重疾险类似，通常涵盖六大类病症，比如心脏病发作。）
【萤火虫老师Tips】

【A Heart attack 心脏病发作（急性的，突发的）】跟【A heart disease 心脏
病（慢性的，可能持续多年，未必会导致最凶险的心脏病发作）】差别非常大，
也是我们
Medical 大课的重要知识点之一。千万不要翻译混，会掉大分。
10. 你也知道，我现在还有一些债要还。如果以后生病了，可能就没办法继续还款了。
所以我觉得这个保险可能是个不错的选择。
(You know, I still have some debts to pay off. If I get sick in the future, I might not be
able to keep up with the payments. So, I think this insurance could be a good option.)
11. Why don’t I give you a few quotes? We can discuss your options and see which one is
right for you.
（要不我给你一些报价？我们可以讨论讨论你都有哪些选择，看看哪种方案最适合
你。）
12. 这个计划听起来不错。你可以给我报价的所有信息吗？
(That sounds like a good plan. Can you send me all the details of the quotes?)
13. I’ll send you a form to fill in. I also need to get some medical information from you to
get a quote for this type of insurance.

（我会发给你一份表格，需要你填写。另外，我还需要一些你的健康信息，才能给
你这类保险的报价。）
14. 好的，谢谢。我会尽快填好表单，然后发给你的。

#70186. Discussing
the
Upcoming
Museum
Visit
–
Education
Briefing：This dialogue takes place between an English-speaking school principal and a
Mandarin-speaking teacher. They are discussing an upcoming class trip. The dialogue
starts now.
1. Hi! I wanted to meet with you to go over the details of the upcoming class trip. I
know there are a lot of things to coordinate, so I thought it’d be good to check in.
(你好！我想和你聊聊即将到来的班级旅行的安排。我知道有很多事情要协调，所以
想和你确认一下。)
2. 您好。真是不好意思，我本来想早点约时间的，但之前一直没能安排上。
(Hi! I’m really sorry. I wanted to schedule/set up a meeting earlier, but I was never able to
make it.)
3. That’s totally fine. You were busy. Can you give me more details about the class trip?
(没关系，你之前很忙。能跟我详细说说班级旅行的安排吗？)
4. 当然可以。班级旅行定在两个星期后。我已经让孩子们把同意书带回家给家长签字
了。
(Of course! The class trip is in two weeks. I’ve already asked the students to take the
consent forms home for their parents to sign.)
5. Great. I hope the parents can return the consent forms on time, as we can’t accept
any forms on the day of the trip.
(很好。希望家长能按时交回同意书，因为我们不能在旅行当天再接收新的表格。)
6. 是的，我已经通知家长了。同意书的截止日期是出发前三天，因为博物馆的工作人
员需要提前确认最终人数。

(Yes, I’ve already informed the parents. The deadline for submission is three days before
departure, as the museum staff need to confirm the final headcount in advance.)
7. Will the children need to bring their own lunch? I’d also like to know if there’s a
designated area where they can eat.
(孩子们需要自己带午餐吗？另外，那边有专门的用餐区吗？)
8. 是的，孩子们可以自己带午餐。博物馆有一个庭院，学生们可以在那里用餐。另外，
他们也提供午餐。吃完饭后，孩子们还可以四处走走，等下午的活动开始。
(Yes, they can bring their own lunch. The museum has a courtyard where students can eat.
They also offer lunch. After lunch, students can walk around before the afternoon session
starts.)
9. That sounds like a great setup. This way, they can have a relaxing lunch break and
be refreshed for the afternoon activities.
(听起来安排得很好。这样他们可以放松地吃午餐，下午的活动也能更好地投入。)
10. 希望是这样吧。下午他们还有作业要完成，所以需要集中注意力。
(I hope so. They still have assignments to complete in the afternoon, so they’ll need to
stay focused.)
11. I’m really looking forward to this trip. It will be great to see what the students take
away from the experience. Plus, it’s always fun to see them engage outside the
classroom.
(我很期待这次旅行，看看学生们能从中学到什么。而且，能看到他们在课堂外积极
参与也会很有趣。)
12. 是啊，希望他们既能学到知识，又能玩得开心。他们每次都特别期待班级旅行，总
想着能走出教室看看外面的世界。
(Yes! Hopefully, they can learn and have fun at the same time. They always look forward
to class trips and are eager to explore beyond the classroom.)

13. That’s true. You probably need to get back to your class now. Let me know if you
have any questions.
(确实是这样。你现在可能要回教室了。如果有问题随时告诉我。)
14. 谢谢！我差点忘了。组织旅行真的很有挑战。如果有问题，我会尽快找您。
(Thank you! I almost forgot. Organizing a trip is really challenging. If I run into any
issues, I’ll reach out to you as soon as possible.)

#70187. Social Worker Directories - Social
Briefing ：This dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking person and her
English-speaking neighbour. They are discussing the challenges of caring for an aged
parent. The dialogue starts now.
1. Good morning, it’s nice to see you. How have you been recently?
（早上好，很高兴见到你。最近怎么样？）
2. 你好，我也很高兴能见到你。我最近因为要经常去看望我母亲, 她身体不太好。所以
我很累。
(Hello, I'm also very glad to see you. Recently, I've been frequently visiting my mother
because her health hasn't been good. That's why I'm really tired.)
3. I remember you once said that she has not been well recently. You must have spent
several hours going back and forth to her house, right?
（我记得你曾经说过她最近身体不太好。你肯定花了好几个小时来回跑她家，对吧？）
4. 是的，要花很多时间。我每周都要去看她，还得工作，几乎没时间做其他事情。
(Yes, it takes a lot of time. I have to visit her every week and also work, so I hardly have
time to do anything else.)
5. That sounds very difficult. I heard that you might talk to a social worker. They could
help you find services suitable for your mother so that visiting her won’t be so tiring.
（听起来真不容易。我听说你可以找社工聊聊。他们可能会帮你看看有没有适合你
母亲的服务，这样探望她就不会那么辛苦了。）
6. 好主意，我之前不知道还能找到这样的帮助。我该去哪儿找社工的联系方式呢？
(Good idea, I didn't know I could find such help. Where can I get the contact information
of a social worker?)

7. There are social worker associations. You can find their services online and on social
media. You can also locate social workers near your mom’s home. There are online
directories available.
（有一些社工协会。你可以在网上和社交媒体上找到他们的服务。你也可以找到离
你母亲住处近的社工，还有在线名录可供查找。）
8. 谢谢你。有了社工名录的帮助，事情会容易很多。要不然，我真不知道该从哪里开
始。
(Thank you. With the help of a social worker directory, things would be much easier.
Otherwise, I really wouldn't know where to start.)
9. Yes. Since these are professional organizations, you can find their names listed in
directories. Elder care is a sensitive matter, so it’s important to find someone
qualified.
（是的。由于这些是专业机构，你可以在名录上查到他们的名字。养老问题很敏感，
所以找到有资质的人很重要。）
10. 感谢你的信息，真的很有帮助。我有很多问题想问他们。如果有人能帮我照顾我妈
直到她好起来，我就放心了。
(Thank you for the information; it's really helpful. I have many questions to ask them. If
someone could take care of my mother until she gets better, I would feel at ease.)
11. It’s always hard when parents get old and need help. It’s harder when they don’t live
nearby.
（父母年纪大了需要帮助总是很不容易的，他们不住在附近的话就更不容易了。）
12. 我们一直想住得离她近点。在她生病之前，我们就开始看房和准备买房了。但她生
病以后，看房计划就搁置了。
(We always want to live closer to her. Before she got sick, we were already looking at
houses and planning to buy one. But after she fell ill, our house-hunting plans were put on
hold.)

13. That’s unfortunate. I hope she recovers soon so you can resume your house hunt.
There are many houses in this area.
（真可惜。我希望她能快点康复，这样你就能继续找房子了。这一带有很多房子。）
14. 是的，我希望我们能找到个好房子。这样我去看望母亲就方便多了。
(Yes, I hope we can find a good place. That way, it will be much more convenient for me
to visit my mother.)

#70188. A Low-score University Assignment– Education
Briefing：This dialogue takes place between an English-speaking university lecturer and
a Mandarin-speaking student. They are discussing ways to improve the student’s
assignment. The dialogue starts now.
1. Good afternoon! Come in and take a seat please. I received your email saying you
wanted to meet me.
（下午好！请进，请坐。我收到了你发的邮件，说你想跟我见面。）
2. 您好。是的。谢谢您抽时间见我。
(Hello. Yes, thank you for taking the time to see me.)
3. That’s totally fine. I try to leave some free time available each day for students. I
hope your studies are going well.
（没关系。我每天都会尽量给学生留出些空余时间。希望你学习进展顺利。）
4. 事实上，我对我第一篇论文的分数不是很满意。我不理解您为什么会给我这么低的
分数。
(In fact, I’m not very satisfied with the grade I received for my first paper/essay. I don’t
understand why you gave me such a low score.)
5. Oh, right. I wanted to have a talk with you about that, but I just haven’t had the
chance.
（哦，对。我本来就想和你谈谈这件事，只是一直没机会。）
6. 我明白。希望您可以给我一些反馈。距离下一节课还有一小时，希望时间足够。
(I understand. I hope you can give me some feedback. There’s still an hour until the next
class, so I hope we have enough time.)
