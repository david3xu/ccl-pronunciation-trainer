#70063. Buying a restaurant – Business
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Jessica, an English-speaking
lawyer and a mandarin-speaking client, who is making an inquiry about buying a new
restaurant. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Hello, my name is Jessica. How can I help you today?
(您好，我是杰西卡。今天我能怎么帮到您呢？)
2.
你好，杰西卡。我想买一个餐厅。我已经问过卖家价格了。
(Hello, Jessica. I’d like to buy a restaurant and I’ve asked the seller about the price.)

词组搭配：ask someone about something
3.
Okay. How’s the business going? Is it profitable?
(好的。餐厅生意怎么样？盈利吗？)
4.
他们生意还挺好的。门口经常排很长的队。
(The business is running very well and people are always waiting in long lines for it. )
5.
Well, it’s important to check its financial record thoroughly so that you can get a
clearer picture of how much you need to run it and how much you can make. You
may also ask a good accountant to review it.
(嗯，彻查一下餐厅的财务记录也是很重要的，这样您更能知道运营这个餐厅要多少
钱，以及您可以赚多少钱。您也可以找个靠谱的会计来看一下。)
6.
好，我会去查一下的。那个卖家还拥有餐厅所在的大楼，说楼也可以租给我。不过
我现在还没那么多钱呢。
(Okay, I’ll have a check. The seller also owns the building of the restaurant and said he
could lease the building to me. But I don’t have that much money now.)

you.

留员工吗？如果保留的话，我再帮你看一下合同。)

8.
那些员工我都会留下的，他们很会做生意的。我需要他们的帮助，把餐厅经营好。
(I’ll keep them. They’re very good at doing business and I could really use their help to
keep the restaurant running smoothly.)
9.
This is a big decision. You can book another appointment once you get those
documents, so that we could can review them together and make sure it’s a the right
decision.
(这是个很重大的决定啊。好的，等您拿到那些文件了，可以再跟我约个时间，我们
一起看一下文件，确保买这个生意是个正确的决定。)
10. 那就太好了。一想到能买这个餐厅，我就非常激动。但是，如果它不赚钱的话，我
也不想做一个错误的决定。
(That’s great. The idea of buying this restaurant really excites me. However, I don’t want
to make a wrong decision if it’s not making money.)

professional advice before buying the business.

you once I have any updates/once I have any new/once any new information comes to
light. Thank you for your help.)

#70064. Buying Home Insurance - Business
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place over the phone between Brian, an insurance
salesperson and a mandarin-speaking client who wants to buy insurance for her new
house. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Hello, this is Brian. What can I do for you?
(你好。我是布莱恩。我可以为您做些什么呢？)
2.
你好，我想给我的新房子买个保险。

【萤火虫老师Tips】

Insurance 不可数

3.
I’m more than happy to help you with that. We have a wide range of insurance for
you to choose from. You may take out insurance to cover your home, your
belongings or both of them.

所有物；行李
4.
我两样都想买。一旦出事了，花我自己的钱去换东西和修房子，太不划算了。
(I’d like to cover both of them. If anything happens, it’s really not worth it to replace my
stuff or repair the house out of my own pocket.)

5.
Well, many people buy insurance for that reason. In your case, I recommend Home
and Contents Insurance. It covers a range of events, such as fire, theft and
attempted theft. It offers repair or replacement of your damaged property as well as
the contents inside it.
(嗯，很多人也是因为这个原因买保险。根据您的情况，我推荐住宅和住宅内物品保
险。这个保险可以报销很多事故，比如说火灾，盗窃，盗窃未遂。对于您受损的房
屋和房屋内的物品，它可以提供维修或置换。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

CCL 重点难词：attempted theft 盗窃未遂

(Okay. This insurance suits me well. My kids are still young, and I do have a concern that
they may break the window when they’re playing football.)
7.
Well, you never know what will happen next. What else do you need to cover? For
example, do you have any other important belongings?
(嗯，世事难料嘛。您还有什么别的想投保的吗？比如说，您还有什么其他重要的东
西吗？)
8.
我还有一台很贵的相机。我可没钱再买第二台了。我以后想成为一名专业的摄影师，
开一个自己的工作室。
(I have a very expensive camera and I don’t think I can afford a second one. I want to
become a professional photographer in the future with my own studio.)
9.
In that case, you may choose our specific insurance, which is a type of property
insurance in which only one individual property is covered by the policy. This
insurance is tailored to protect your special item.
(这样的话，您可以选择我们的特定保险/单独保险。这种财产保险的保单里只会保
一样个人财产。这个保险是为保护您的特殊物品量身定制的。)

I hope the payout/ the amount insured is enough while the premium is acceptable.)

questions. Thank you for your help.)
