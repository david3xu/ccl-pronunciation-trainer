Customers injured on your business premises may sue you. The insurance will
provide financial protection if that happens.
（客户在您的营业场所受伤，可能会起诉您。如果发生这种情况，保险会提供财务
保护。）
8.
哦，我明白了，这可能是最重要的保险，可以降低我生意的风险。作为经营食品生
意的老板，我不知道我还需不需要别的保险。
(Oh, I understand. This might be the most important insurance to reduce the risk of my
business. As a food business owner, I'm not sure if I need any other insurance.)
9.
We also have this kind of insurance which can cover any claims customers may
make regarding issues with your products, and it also covers the replacement of
your equipment if it breaks.
（我们也有这种保险：它可以赔付客户因您的产品问题可能提出的任何索赔，而且
如果您的设备坏了，这份保险也保更换费用。）
10. 我不太清楚需不需要分别买每一种保险，我听朋友说好像有包含所有我需要的保险
套餐。
(I'm not sure if I need to buy each type of insurance separately. I heard from a friend
that there might be a package that includes all the insurance I need.)
11. Your friend is correct, we can have a meeting and discuss your insurance needs, and
I will give you a quote based on your suitable package.
(您的朋友是对的，我们可以开个会讨论您的保险需求，我会根据适合您的套餐给您
报价。)
12. 太好了，我最近两周都有空，请你在有空的时候给我打电话。
(Great, I'm available for the next two weeks. Please call me when you have time.)

last around 1 hour.
(下周四下午2 点，适合您吗？我想会议大约会持续一个小时。)

#70156. Disability Parking Permit – Legal
Briefing:
This
conversation
takes
place
over
the
phone
between
John,
an
English-speaking
employee
from
the
Department
of
Social
Services
and
a
Mandarin-speaking customer who wants to apply for a disability parking permit. The
dialogue starts now.
1.
Good morning. Thanks for calling the Department of Social Services. This is John
speaking.
（早上好。感谢您致电社会服务部。我是约翰。）
2.
早上好。我需要了解残疾人停车许可证的信息。但是我不知道是不是你们这个部门。
(Good morning. I need to inquire about some information regarding the disability
parking permit, but I’m not sure if this department is the right one.）
3.
This is the nominated department when it comes to applying for disability parking
permits. You are calling the right place. How can I help you today?
（这是负责残疾人停车许可证申请的指定部门。您的电话打对地方了。我今天能为
您做些什么？）
4.
嗯，我在网上看过你们的网站。上面有很多关于残疾人停车许可证的信息。但我还
是有一个问题。
(Hmm, I have checked your website online. There is a lot of information about the
disability parking permit, but I still have a question.）
5.
No problem. We make sure our website is comprehensive and easy to understand.
Sometimes, it is easier to just make a call.
（没问题，我们确保我们的网站内容全面且易于理解。有时候，打个电话更方便。）
6.
我明白了。我儿子经常开我的车，他对能把车停到指定的残疾人停车位感到很兴奋。

请问他是可以这么做的吗？
(I understand. My son often drives my car, and he's excited about being able to park in a
designated disability parking space. May I ask if he is allowed to do that?)
7.
I have bad news for your son. The parking permit is only valid when the vehicle is
being used to transport the permit holder, which means the permit holder needs to
be inside the car.
(我有个坏消息要告诉您儿子。停车许可证只有在用来接送持证人的情况下才有效，
这意味着持证人必须在车内。)
8.
我觉得我儿子不会自己使用这个停车许可证。如果我把这个消息告诉我儿子，他肯
定会很失望的。
(I don’t think my son will use the parking permit on his own. If I tell him this, he will
definitely be very disappointed.)
9.
The parking permit is valid when the permit holder is inside the car. There will be
no problem as long as the permit holder is physically present.
(持证人坐在车内时，停车许可证就有效。只要持证人实际在场，就不会有问题。)
10. 我可以让我儿子心甘情愿地送我去商店。我还没有申请呢。我想我应该要尽快申请
了。
(I can ask my son to willingly take me to the store. I haven’t applied yet, and I think I
should do it as soon as possible.）
11. It might be a good idea if you apply for the permit as soon as possible. The
department will take some time to process your application.
(尽快申请这个许可证可能是个好主意。部门处理您的申请会需要一些时间。)
12. 好的。我在网站上看过你们的申请表，这样就容易多了。我想知道，许可证批下来
我需要等多久呢？
(Okay. I’ve seen your application form on the website, and it’s much easier this way. I’d

like to know how long I’ll need to wait until the permit gets granted?)
13. It would be 4 weeks to process your application, but if there are more supporting
documents available, the process would be quicker.
（处理您的申请需要四周时间，但如果有更多的证明材料，流程会更快。)
14. 那我最好还是马上开始申请。我会确保准备好所有文件的。谢谢你的帮助, 约翰。
(Then I’d better start the application right away. I’ll make sure to have all the documents
ready. Thank you for your help, John.)

Briefing: This phone conversation takes place over the phone between Alex, an
English-speaking insurance company employee, and a Mandarin-speaking customer
who wants to make an enquiry about the insurance that suits her. The dialogue starts
now.
1.
Good morning. Thanks for calling our insurance company. This is Alex speaking.
(早上好。感谢致电我们保险公司。我是艾利克斯。)
2.
你好，艾利克斯。我打电话来，是想了解你们的医疗保险。我从来没有买过医保。
(Hello, Alex. I'm calling to learn about your health insurance. I've never bought one
before.）
3.
No problem，I am glad to help you. We have a range of options. It depends on the
level of coverage you need and your budget.
(没问题，我很乐意帮助你。我们有多种选择。这取决于你需要的保险等级和预算。)
4.
哦，原来是这样，我不确定我需要买什么等级的保险。我在你们网站上看到过，但
是我还是不太明白。
(Oh, I see. I'm not sure what level of insurance I need. I’ve seen it on your website, but I
still don't quite understand.）
5.
I see. We have a range of policies for you to choose from. Please tell me about
yourself. I’m sure we can help you find the policy that’s right for you.
（我明白了。我们有多种保单供你选择。请告诉我一些关于你的信息。我相信我们
可以帮助你找到适合你的保单。）
6.
我最近刚满30 岁，我也一直有在做体育运动。整体上来说，我身体很健康。但是
我知道, 意外随时可能发生。

(I recently just turned 30, and I’ve been doing sports. Overall, I’m in good health. But I
know accidents can happen at any time.）
7.
You are still young. It seems like you don’t have any medical issues. If that’s the
case, you probably don’t need to buy our gold insurance, which is the top one.
(你还很年轻。看来你没有任何健康问题。如果是这样的话，你可能不需要购买我
们的金级保险，那是最高级别的。)
8.
我在网上看过你们的金级保险。但它真的太贵了。保险里面包含的膝盖置换手术，
我觉得我不太需要。
(I’ve seen your gold insurance online. But it’s really too expensive. The knee replacement
surgery coverage included in it—I don’t think I need that.)
9.
Then our bronze insurance will suit you more. It doesn’t cover things such as
broken bones.
(那么我们的铜级保险更适合你。这个保险不保像骨折这样的情况。)
10. 我也不想发生这种事情。但是，谁知道呢。以防万一，最好还是要有能保在运动中
受伤的保险。
(I don’t want those things to happen either. But who knows? Just in case, it’s better to
have insurance that covers injuries from sports.）
11. This insurance covers surgeries and a range of treatments. The monthly premium is
much cheaper than the previous level of coverage.
（这种保险涵盖手术和一系列治疗。每月的保费比之前那个级别的保险便宜得多。）
12. 那真是太好了。在这个阶段，我可能不太需要购买包含治疗项目的保险，这没有多
大意义。
(That’s great. At this stage, I probably don’t need to buy insurance that includes treatment
options—it doesn’t make much sense.）

coverage and what’s not, to help you make a decision.
（我把保单详情发你。这样你能看到你的保险包含哪些，不包含哪些，来帮你做决

carefully, and after I’ve made up my mind, I’ll contact you again to see which policy to
buy.）

#70158. Catering Business Ideas – Business
Briefing: The following dialogue happens in a fresh food market between an
English-speaking business school teacher and her former student. They are talking
about the student’s catering business. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Hello, I haven't seen you since you finished your business course. What a nice
coincidence to see you here!
（你好，你上完商业课程以后，我就没见过你了。真巧在这里遇到你。）
2.
你好。是啊。我每天在这里为我的生意采购新鲜食材。我也很高兴见到你。
(Hello. Yes, I come here every day to buy fresh ingredients for my business. I'm also very
happy to see you.)
3.
I’m really glad to see that you have your own business. How's your business going?
（很开心你有了自己的生意。你的生意怎么样了？）
4.
最近很好。我刚刚搬到一个大一点的场地，在一个大商场旁边。我需要一个更大的
场地。
(It's been going well recently. I just moved to a bigger place, next to a large shopping
mall. I needed more space.)
5.
That's exciting! I want to hear more about it. Do you have time to sit and talk with
me?
（那很让人激动啊。我想多了解了解。你有时间坐下来跟我聊聊吗？）
6.
有。在我开始工作之前还有几分钟时间。我也想和你聊聊生意上的事。
(Yes, I have a few minutes before I start work. I'd also like to talk to you about business
matters.)

Good. I'm happy to help if I can. Do you need any advice on business ideas?
（很好。如果我能帮到你的话，我很开心。你需要一些关于商业点子的建议吗？）
8.
嗯。现在我接到更多晚宴订单。我有个想法，我可以为其他文化做传统美食。
(Yes. I'm getting more orders for dinner events. I have an idea to make traditional dishes
for other cultures.)
9.
Do you know what culture you want to cook for? You may need to create a list of
recipes and ingredients.
（你知道你想做哪种文化的菜吗？你可能需要准备一个菜谱和食材清单。）
10. 是啊，不过那会很有趣。我不确定是哪种文化。我需要发掘。
(Yes, but it would be fun. I'm not sure which culture it will be yet. I need to explore that.)
11. A survey of your customers might help. You don't want to serve food your
customers aren't interested in.
（对你的客户进行调研可能会有帮助。你也不想提供他们不感兴趣的食物。）
12. 有道理。我需要考虑一下再决定。做事情没必要匆匆忙忙的。
(That makes sense. I need to think it through before deciding. There's no need to rush.)
13. You're in a good position. You're doing well, and you have time to think about the
next step. Now you need to work.
（你现在的情况很棒。你做得很好，而且有时间考虑下一步。现在你需要去工作啦。）
14. 是的。我没时间了，不过我很高兴和你谈话。感谢你倾听我的想法。
(Yes. I'm running out of time, but it’s been great talking with you. Thank you for hearing
my thoughts.)
