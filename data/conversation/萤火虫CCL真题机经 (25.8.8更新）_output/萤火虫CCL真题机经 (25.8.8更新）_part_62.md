#70195. Office Meeting on Remote Work Challenges –
Business
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking employee
and
an
English-speaking
manager.
They
are
discussing
the
work-from-home
arrangement and addressing related technical issues. The dialogue starts now.
1. Good morning. I really appreciate you taking the time to come to the office to meet
me today.
（早上好。感谢你今天抽空来办公室和我见面。）
2. 早上好啊。没事的。能见到你和团队的其他人，我很开心。
(Good morning. It’s okay. I'm really glad to see you and the other members of the team.)
3. That’s good to know. I’d like to have a quick chat with you about how your
work-from-home setup is coming along. How are things going so far?
（那挺好的。我想跟你简单聊聊你在家办公的安排情况。目前都还好吗？）
4. 目前都挺好的。虽然我很想念你们，但是不用每天跑办公室上班，真的是帮我省了
不少的通勤时间啊！
(So far, so good/ Everything’s been great. Although I really miss you all, not having to go
to/rush over to/ make the daily trek to the office every day has really saved me a lot of
commuting time!)
【萤火虫老师Tips】
“跑”办公室的“跑”的几种进阶fancy 表达：

“rush over to the office” 有“急匆匆过去”的画面感；“rush to 某地”和“rush
over to 某地”都可以用，意思相似。不过“rush over to”更有一种轻松随意的
语气。

“make the daily trek to the office” 强调每天往返办公室像在进行一段旅程一样

（不论是步行、坐公交还是开车），可形象表达通勤的辛苦和耗时。
5. Well, we miss having you around as well, but it's great to know you're enjoying
working from home. I understand how much it matters to you.
（嗯，我们也很想念跟你一起工作。不过，了解到你喜欢居家办公真是太好了。我
理解这对你来说很重要。）
6. 是呀。不用再花两个小时在通勤上，真的给我带来了很大的变化。我现在感觉精力
充沛了不少。
(Yes, not having to spend two hours commuting has made a huge difference. I feel much
more energetic now.)
7. That’s wonderful to hear. But I’ve been informed by the IT Department that you’ve
encountered some technical problems recently.
（真是太好了。不过，信息技术部跟我说你最近遇到了一些技术问题。）
8. 是呀，我家里的网络状况不是很好，尤其是在高峰时段，网速很慢，有时甚至会崩
溃。
(Yes, my internet connection isn’t very good, especially during peak hours/ at peak times:
it gets really slow and sometimes it even crashes/ it even breaks down.)
9. I noticed that you get disconnected from online meetings occasionally, though I
wasn’t aware that it was due to technical glitches.
（我注意到线上会议时你偶尔会掉线，但我不知道这是技术问题/故障造成的。）
【萤火虫老师Tips】

“Glitches” 这个词在日常生活、科技和游戏领域中很流行。特别在年轻人和
游戏博主中用得很多。可以描述软件或硬件中的问题、故障。

当大家吐槽某款游戏时，可能会说“The game has a lot of glitches,” 意味着游
戏画面或操作上有些小毛病、不流畅。这种说法比“bugs”来得更随意、更生
活化。带有一种调侃和轻松的语气。


形容日常生活中遇到的“小毛病”时也会用这个词。例如，当设备偶尔出现点
小问题时，年轻人常说“My phone’s acting glitchy today,” 表示手机有些小毛
病。
10. 唉。我试过把路由器放到家里的每一个角落，但是都没有用。技术人员建议更换一
台新设备，还要升级到更快的套餐。
(Ah, I've tried placing the router in every corner of the house, but nothing worked. The
technician suggested replacing it with a new device and upgrading to a faster plan.)
11. I see. We’ll arrange to get you a new network device and switch you over to a
higher-level plan.
（我了解了。我们会给你更换一台新的网络设备，并且帮你升级到一个更高级的套
餐。）
12. 好的。我都开始担心这些问题会影响我的工作效率和工作量了，技术故障真是让人
头疼啊！
(Okay. I’m starting to worry that these issues will affect my work efficiency and workload;
technical glitches are such a headache!)
13. 13.Don’t worry. I’ll talk with the appropriate team, and once we have the go-ahead,
I’ll let you know. You’re also welcome to reach out to them directly to get it resolved.
(别担心。我会跟相关团队沟通，一批下来就通知你。你也可以直接联系他们解决。)

#70196. Pharmacist Advice for Flu-Like Symptoms
–
Medical
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking mother and
an English-speaking pharmacist. They are discussing a viral infection affecting her
daughter and herself. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hi, you seem a bit under the weather. What can I do for you?
（嗨，你看上去好像身体不太舒服。有什么我能帮忙的吗？）
2. 是呀。我很难受。我女儿大概从一周前就开始咳嗽了，现在我也咳嗽起来了，我感
觉我好像也感染了同一种病毒。
(Yes, I feel unwell. About a week ago, my daughter started coughing, and now I'm
coughing too. I feel like I've caught the same virus.)
3. Oh dear, there's quite a potent virus circulating these days, and many people have
already been hit by it.
（哎呀，最近有一种很强/厉害的病毒在传播，已经影响到很多人了。）
4. 医生说我女儿不用吃药，只要呆在家休息，不去上学就行。她现在已经恢复了，不
过我病得比她严重，感觉特别难受。
(The doctor said my daughter doesn't need any medication and should just stay home
instead of going to school. She's recovered now, but I'm much sicker than her and feel
really awful.)
5. Well, kids usually bounce back from viral infections more quickly than adults. I'm
sorry you've caught it too. It’s quite unfortunate. This virus can be quite contagious.
（孩子通常比大人更快从病毒感染中恢复。很遗憾你也感染了。太不幸了。这个病
毒传染性很强。）

6. 没错，这病毒的传染性实在是太强了。你能不能帮我开点药，让我感觉好一点呢？
(Yeah, this virus is so contagious. Could you prescribe some medication to help me feel a
bit better?)
7. Unfortunately, no medicine can cure a viral infection outright. The virus usually has
to run its course while your body heals on its own, which can take a while.
（遗憾的是，没有任何药物能直接治愈病毒感染。通常病毒需要靠你身体自己恢复，
这可能得花一段时间。）
8. 我感觉是实在太糟了，全身酸痛，就连躺在床上也觉得疼。而且，我还发烧了。
(I feel really terrible; my whole body aches and even lying in bed is painful. I also have a
fever.)
9. I understand. Although I can't directly prescribe medicine here, I can definitely
recommend some over-the-counter options that may help lower your fever and let
you sleep better.
（我明白。虽然我不能直接给你开药，但我完全可以推荐一些非处方药，它们可能
可以帮你退烧，让你睡得更好些。）
【萤火虫老师Tips】

在澳大利亚，通常顾客先找【GP - 全科医生】开处方，然后拿着处方去药房买
药。药剂师会提供用药建议和推荐非处方药。
10. 太好了，发烧真是太难熬了。一开始我觉得特别冷，接着出了好多汗，热得要命。
而且我的喉咙也很痛。刀割一样疼。
(That's great, having a fever is really miserable/awful/brutal. At first, I felt really cold, and
then I was sweating a lot/I was sweating heavily/ I broke out in a heavy sweat. It was
unbearably hot. And my throat hurts like I’m being cut by a knife /Plus, my throat is
hurting so badly, it feels like it's being sliced with a knife.)

11. You might try some throat lozenges that might ease your sore throat. You could also
try some steam inhalation, which can help soothe your cough.
（你可以试试含点含片，可能会缓解你的喉咙痛。你也可以试试吸蒸汽，有助于缓
解咳嗽。）
12. 好的，我试试。非常感谢你。我真希望我能快点好，我不能一直待在家里，耽误上
班了。
(Alright, I'll give that a try. Thanks a lot. I really hope I can get better soon. I can't keep
staying home and missing work.)
13. Yes, while the medicine won’t tackle the virus itself, it should definitely help with the
symptoms. I hope you feel better soon and can get back to work.
（是的，虽然药物不能直接治好病毒，但肯定能缓解你的症状。希望你快点好起来，
能回去上班。）
14. 非常感谢你的帮助。生病真是太麻烦了，总让人觉得特别难受，我真心希望能尽快
恢复正常。
(Thank you so much for your help. I really hate being sick / Being sick is such a hassle. It
always makes you feel awful/terrible. I truly hope to get back to normal as soon as
possible.)

#70197. Police Call About House Invasion – Legal
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking homeowner
and an English-speaking police operator. They are discussing a break-in at the
homeowner’s house. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hi. You’ve reached the Australian Police Assistance Hotline. This is Officer Williams
speaking. How may I be of service today?
（你好，你已拨通澳大利亚警察求助热线，我是警官威廉姆斯。今天有什么可以为
你效劳的吗？）
2. 警察同志你好。我家突然有人闯进来了，我现在完全不知道该怎么办才好.
(Hello, officer. Someone broke into my house, and I really have no idea what to do now.)
3. Alright, the most important thing is your safety. First, ensure you’re okay and if
anyone is still inside, please stay out.
（好的，最重要的是确保您的安全。首先，确认您没事，如果家里还有人，请不要
进去。）
4. 目前家里已经没有人了。我刚到家时发现房里空荡荡的没人，但明显看得出之前有
人来过。太吓人了。
(Now there's nobody inside. I just got home and found the place empty with no one inside,
but it’s clear someone was there earlier. It’s so scary.)
5. I see. Please try to keep calm and start from the beginning. Can you explain what
happened?
（我明白。请尽量保持冷静，从头开始跟我说说到底发生了什么？）
6. 好的，我尽量平复一下我的情绪吧。我刚刚旅游回来，发现家里被翻得乱七八糟。
而且，洗衣房的窗户被砸破了！

(Okay, I'll try to calm down. I just got back from a trip and found my home completely
ransacked/messed up. The laundry room window also got smashed!)
7. It appears they gained entry by smashing the laundry room window. I know this
situation is chaotic, but could you check if anything has been stolen?
（他们可能是通过砸破洗衣房的窗户闯进去的。我知道情况很混乱，但你能否确认
一下有没有东西被盗走？）
8. 哎呀，我还没来得及细看所有的东西呢，因为我第一时间就打电话给你们了。不过，
我发现电视和立体声音响不见了，而且还有一台电脑也没了。
(Oh boy. I haven’t had the chance to look over everything in detail since I called you
immediately. However, I noticed the TV is gone, the stereo is gone, and a computer is
missing.)
9. Alright, please refrain from tidying up or touching anything at the scene. I’ll
dispatch an officer to your residence so you can file a report regarding the stolen
items.
（好的，请不要清理或碰动现场的任何东西。我会派一名警官到您家，让您报案记
录被盗物品的情况。）
10. 天啊，我真是难以置信会有人做出这种事。虽然我家里没有特别贵重的东西，但要
重新买回这些东西还是很麻烦啊。
(Oh my god. I really can’t believe someone would do something like this. Even though I
don’t have any highly valuable items at home, replacing these things is still no easy task/is
still a hassle/is still not easy.)
11. If your home and belongings are insured, your insurance should help cover the cost
of replacing the stolen items. Also, could you check if anything else is missing?
（如果您的房屋和物品都有保险，保险应该可以帮您赔偿更换被盗的物品。另外，
您能再确认一下是否还有别的东西被偷了吗？）

12. 对对对，我竟然忘了我还有保险！保险肯定能帮上忙。要是可以的话，我想等警察
来了以后，我再详细检查整个房子.
(Oh right! I can’t believe I forgot about my insurance! It definitely should help. If possible,
I’d prefer to check the entire house carefully after the police arrive.)
13. Definitely, it’s a smart idea to wait inside your car until the police show up so
nothing gets disturbed. It won’t take much time.
（当然，最好是在车里等到警察到达，这样可以确保不破坏现场。时间不会太久的。）
14. 非常感谢你们帮忙。回家看到这种情况，真是我最不想遇到的。你们的帮助实在是
救了我一命啊。
(Thank you so much for your help. This is the last thing I ever wanted to see when I got
home, your assistance has truly been a lifesaver.)
