12. 我喜欢烹饪。我很乐意准备食物。我可能没有计划做什么特别的食物，就准备一些
小吃吧。
(I enjoy cooking, and I'd be happy to prepare some food. I might not plan anything special,
just some snacks.)
13. We could go to the supermarket to get some supplies and drinks. I can’t wait to
make my favorite iced lemon tea.
（我们可以去超市买一些材料和喝的东西。我迫不及待想做我最爱的冰镇柠檬茶了。）

#70163. Guiding a Daughter’s School Transition– Social
+ Education
Briefing: The following conversation takes place between a Mandarin-speaking mother
and an English-speaking social worker. They are discussing how to support her
daughter in adjusting to a new school. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hello, please come in and take a seat! I’m glad to see you. I’ve been wanting to ask
you: how is your daughter doing at her new school?
（你好，请进, 请坐！很开心见到你。我一直想问你呢：你女儿在新学校过得怎么样?）
2. 我非常高兴您打电话问我。我一直想约时间跟您见一面，聊一聊。
(I'm really glad you called to ask me. I've been wanting to set up a time to meet with you
and chat.)
3. You mentioned before that changing schools was a good thing for your daughter, but
it seems she’s encountering some issues now.
（你之前跟我说, 你感觉换学校对你女儿来说很好，但好像现在她遇到了一些问题。)
4. 是的，转学以后，她的成绩有提高。但是，她在社交方面好像有些困难。她到现在
还没有交到任何新朋友呢。
(Yes, her grades have improved since the transfer. However, she seems to be having some
difficulties socially. She still hasn’t made any new friends.)
5. It’s great that her grades have improved; that’s a very positive sign. Just give her
some time to adjust to the school, and gradually she will start making friends.
（她的成绩有提高是很棒的。这是个很积极的信号。就多给她点时间去适应学校吧，
然后渐渐地，她就会开始交朋友了。）

6. 或许吧。我有点担心她。她没有跟我说过什么，但是我知道，她感觉非常孤独。我
也不希望她的成绩下降。
（Maybe. I’m a bit worried about her. She hasn’t said anything to me, but I know she
feels very lonely. I don’t want her grades to drop either.）
7. Perhaps you could help her find some after school activities that suit her. That way,
she might meet some students in similar situations. What does she enjoy doing?
（也许你可以给她看看有没有适合她的课外活动。这样她或许可以遇见和她有相似
处境的学生。她喜欢做什么呢?）
8. 她在她以前的学校参加了乐队的。她离开的时候，她还在乐队里学习。她似乎很享
受乐队活动。
(She was in the band at her previous school. When she left, she was still learning in the
band. She seemed to really enjoy the band activities.)
9. I think the school band is a great idea. It can give her a chance to make friends in a
small group setting.
（我认为学校乐队是很好的想法。这可以给她一个在小团体里结交朋友的机会。）
10. 您真的说到点子上了。她以前是学吹长笛的。我可以和乐队老师确认一下，看一看
还能不能让她继续学。
(You’ve got it spot on / You’ve made a very valid point/ You’re absolutely right/ You’ve
really hit the mark/ You’ve hit the nail on the head. She used to play the flute. I can check
with the band teacher to see if she can continue learning.)
11. She could even learn a new instrument. She might also be interested in learning
something new. It depends on the band’s display arrangements such as the setlist
and stage setup.
（她甚至可以学个新乐器。她应该也会对学习新东西感兴趣。这要看乐队的演出安
排，比如曲目清单和舞台布置。）

12. 她马上就放学回家了。我会和她聊一聊。看她想不想尝试一下进乐队。
(She will be home from school soon. I’ll talk to her and see if she wants to try joining the
band.)
13. Alright. You can encourage her to give it a try. Encourage her to put in some extra
effort. I think that would be very helpful.
（好的。你可以鼓励她试试看。鼓励她多努力一点。我觉得这会很有帮助。）
14. 我同意您说的。我很难知道还能再为她做些什么了。但和您聊过以后，真的帮到我
很多。谢谢您。
(I agree with what you said. I find it hard to know what else I can do for her. But talking
with you has really helped me a lot. Thank you.)

#70164. Resignations and Terminations – Legal
Briefing: The following dialogue happens over the phone between an English-speaking
lawyer and a Mandarin-speaking small business owner who wants to sell her business
and is seeking legal advice. The dialogue starts now.
1. Good morning. Thanks for calling our law firm. How can I help you with your legal
matter today? We’re here to support you, so feel free to share any details you're
comfortable with.
（早上好，感谢您致电我们律师事务所。今天我能如何帮助您解决您的法律问题呢？
我们在这里为您提供帮助，您可以分享您愿意透露的任何细节。）
2. 早上好。我需要咨询一些法律建议。你们的网站上说，你们专门帮助做小生意的人。
好像你们的口碑也很好。
(Good morning. I need some legal advice. Your website mentions that you specialize in
helping small business owners, and it seems like your reputation is quite good.)
3. Thank you, we really appreciate all the positive feedback. We always strive to
provide the best service for our clients. We offer guidance to business owners on
both commercial and employment issues. So why do you need legal advice?
（感谢您。我们很感激所有的好评。我们一直致力于为客户提供最优质的服务。我
们为企业主/生意老板提供商业和雇佣问题上的指导。那么，您为什么需要法律建议
呢？）
4. 是这样的：我有一家小型零售店，雇佣了三名员工。但我决定要卖掉这个生意。我
不得不说，这是一个艰难的决定。
(Here is the thing: I have a small retail store and employ three staff members. However,
I've decided to sell the business. I have to say, it’s a tough decision.)

5. I see. I can assist you with the legal aspects of selling your business, if you'd like.
Additionally, I can help you make any adjustments regarding staffing.
（我明白了。如果您愿意，我可以帮您处理卖生意的法律事务。此外，我还可以帮
助您在员工安排上做任何调整。）
6. 谢谢。我需要您帮我起草一份买卖合同。我刚刚找到一个买家。事情发生的比我预
想的要快很多。而且，我的组织能力不是很好。
(Thank you. I need your help drafting a sales contract. I just found a buyer. Things are
moving much faster than I expected, and my organizational skills aren't very strong.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

“Sales contract” 更加强调法律约束力的书面文件。

“Sales agreement” 则可以更广泛地应用于口头或书面的销售协议。两个都是正
确的表达。通常可以互换使用。
7. Congratulations! I can help you draft the contract. That won’t be a problem. When
do you need to terminate the employment contracts with the staff members? I can
assist you with that as well.
（恭喜你！我可以帮你起草合同，这没问题的。你什么时候需要解除与员工的劳动
合同？我也可以帮助你处理这个。）
8. 其中的两位员工，已经找到新工作了。我对此感觉到很高兴。第三位员工准备退休
了。
(Two of the employees have already found new jobs, and I'm quite happy about that. The
third employee is preparing to/ getting ready to retire.)

9. That would be a good outcome for all of you. There will be some forms for you to fill
out. I can help to make sure you complete them correctly and comply with
government regulations.
（那对你们所有人来说都会是一个很好的结果。您有一些表格要填写。我可以帮您
确保填写正确，并符合政府规定。）
10. 谢谢你。自从我开业以来，我的员工就一直在为我工作。我从来没有处理过辞职或
者解雇的问题。
(Thank you. Ever since I started my business, my employees have been working for me.
I've never dealt with resignations or terminations/firings before.)
11. You must be a really good boss! And it sounds you’ve had a stable team. We can
work on the sales contract and the employment contracts at the same time. There’s a
lot to take care of.
（您一定是个很好的老板！而且听起来您的团队很稳定。我们可以同时处理销售合
同和劳动合同。要做的事情很多。）
12. 谢谢你的夸奖。我尽量做好。是的，我还有很多存货和设备，也需要包含在这个卖
生意的合同里。事情确实有点复杂，但我相信在你的帮助下，可以顺利进行。
(Thanks for the compliment! I tried my best. Yes, I also have a lot of inventory and
equipment that need to be included in the sales contract/ agreement. It is a bit complicated,
but I believe things can be done smoothly with your help.)
13. Of course. I’m here to guide you through every step of the process. Why don't we
schedule a time to organize your contracts? If that works for you, we can meet
tomorrow at 2 PM.
（当然可以。我会在每一步过程中指导你。我们约个时间把你的合同整理一下怎么
样？如果你觉得合适，我们可以明天下午2 点见。）

immigration officer from the Department of Home Affairs and a Mandarin-speaking

6. 我的朋友下个月要结婚了。我想回去参加她的婚礼。但是，我不确定我可以这样做
吗?
(My friend is getting married next month. I would like to go back to attend her wedding.
However, I'm not sure if I can do that.)
7. That sounds exciting! The Working Holiday Visa allows you to travel in and out of
Australia as many times as you wish.
（听起来很令人兴奋! 打工度假签证是允许您多次往返澳大利亚的。）
【萤火虫老师Tips】

“travel” 是一个多义词，它不仅仅指“旅游”，还可以指“往返”或“出行”等其他含
义。具体翻译要根据上下文灵活决定。这一段“travel” 更倾向于表达“进出”或
“往返”的意思，而不一定是“旅游”。
8. 听你这么说, 我就放心了。我现在只需要回家一个星期, 然后，我会回来工作的。我
刚找到一份新工作。
(I am relieved to hear that. I only need to go home for a week, and then I will be back to
work. I just found a new job.)
9. That’s great! You must be excited about that. The Working Holiday Visa is a very
good way for you to travel here.
（太好了！您一定对此很兴奋。旅游度假签证是您在这里旅行的一个很好的方式。）
10. 我想多挣点钱去环游澳大利亚。这里有很多美丽的地方值得一去。我想开车北上，
去看看美丽的北海岸。我也想去看看北领地。
(I want to earn some extra money to travel around Australia. There are many beautiful
places worth visiting here. I want to drive north to see the beautiful north coast. I also
want to check out the Northern Territory.)
11. I’m sure the sights along the way are beautiful. I hope you have a wonderful time. Do
you have any other questions about your visa conditions? If so, don't hesitate to call
us back.
