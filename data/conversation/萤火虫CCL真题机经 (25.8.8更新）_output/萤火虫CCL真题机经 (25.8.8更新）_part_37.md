#70113. Seeking for more weekend shifts – Business
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place in a factory between a Mandarin-speaking
worker and Mr. Howard, the owner of the factory. The worker wants to ask for extra
shifts. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hello. I thought you must have finished work and gone home.
(你好, 我以为你都做完工作回家了。)
2. 没有，我在等着跟您商量事情。我想问一下我能不能在周末多工作一点时间。
(No. I’m waiting for you to discuss something/ I’m waiting for you, hoping to discuss
something with you. I wonder if I could ask for more weekend shifts.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

“I’m waiting for someone, hoping …” 这个句式更委婉客气。
3. It is early to ask more shifts because you’ve just started here. How about we wait for
a month and see how it’s going?
(因为你才刚开始工作，要求多排点班太早了。要不我们再等一个月，看看情况再
说？)
4. 我知道我才刚开始在这工作，但是我工作得很卖力。我的经理说我是包装最快的工
人之一。
(I know that I have just started here. But I work really hard. My manager said I was one
of the fastest packers.)

shifts with more wages.
(是的，我知道。你做得非常好。如果你可以的话，或许你可以多上一些工资更高的
夜班。)
6. 但是我只能在周末和平时工作日的白天工作。我在晚上要上英语课程和其他的一些
课程。很抱歉我不能上夜班。

classes and some other classes during evenings. I’m sorry I can’t take night shifts. )

That’s why I want more shifts.)
9. I see. Our shifts right now are full, but there will be someone away from work or sick.
I don’t know if you can accept short notice to come to work.
(我了解了。我们现在的排班都很满了。但是会有人上不了班或者生病的时候。我不

starts after the shifts end.
(我知道你是乘坐公共交通来上班的。但是周末的公共交通是在上班时间结束以后才
有的。)
12. 这对我来说不是个问题。我有个朋友也在周末上班，我可以坐他/她的车。上班不会
迟到。
(It won’t be a problem for me. I have a friend who also works during weekends and could
offer me a ride. I won’t be late for work.)
13. Well, it sounds that you have sorted out the problem. I will tell your supervisor to
call you if there are shifts on weekend.
(嗯，听上去你已经把问题都解决了。如果周末有班的话，我会让你主管给你打电话
的。)
14. 太好了。非常谢谢你霍华德先生。我不会让您失望的。
