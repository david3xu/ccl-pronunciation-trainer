inform our fraud department.
(这好像就很可疑了。有人盗取了你的账户信息，然后在网上使用了。我会通知我们
的反欺诈部门的。)
8. 但是我的信用卡还在我钱包里啊，别人怎么可能使用的呢？
(But my credit card is still in my wallet. How could someone else use it?)
9. They might get your details through your online purchase. It happens when the
website is not secure.
(他们可能是通过你的网购记录来获得了你的信息。如果网站不够安全的话，这种事
会发生的。)
10. 太可怕了，我不知道该怎么办，我付不起这些额外的费用啊，这可是一大笔钱。
(That’s horrible. I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford those extra charges. It’s a lot of
money.)
11. Don’t worry. You don’t need to pay it. We will reverse the charges and cancel your
card. So, it will not happen again.
(别担心。你是不需要支付这些费用的。我们会把这些费用撤回，还会把你的卡取消。
这样的话就不会再发生这种事了。)
12. 那我就放心了，谢谢。将来我在网上使用信用卡一定会非常小心。
(Then I can put my mind at ease. Thanks. I’ll be super careful when I use my credit card
online in the future.)
13. I’ll send you a new card today. You will need to update your regular payments and
new details.
(我会今天给你发一张新卡的。你需要在常用付款那边和个人信息那边都更新一下。)
14. 谢谢你的帮助和理解，詹姆士。我本来还很担心。
(Thank you for your help and understanding, James. I was so worried.)

#70095. Finding a part-time job on campus – Business
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place in a university between Mark, an
English-speaking student centre advisor, and a Mandarin-speaking university student.
The student would like to find a part-time job on campus. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hi. This is the university student centre. My name is Mark. How can I help you
today?
(你好这是大学学生中心，我是马克，今天我能如何帮到你呢？)
2. 你好，马克。我想问一下有关学生找工作的事情。朋友告诉我，校内应该就有工作。
(Hi mark, I want to make an enquiry about finding a job as a student. My friend told me
that there should be some jobs available on campus.)
3. The university employment website lists all the jobs on campus. There are full time
and part time jobs available.
(大学的求职网站列有全部校内的工作，全职工作和兼职工作都有的。)
4. 我在找兼职工作，我没办法应付全职工作，因为我的课业十分繁重。
(I am looking for a part-time job. I don’t think I’m able to handle a full-time one, because
I have a heavy course load.)
5. I can totally understand that. I know it is really difficult for students to study and do
a full-time job. That's why the part time jobs on campus are so popular.
(我完全可以理解。我知道对于学生来说，又学习又全职工作真的很难。这也是为什
么学校里的兼职工作这么受欢迎。)
6. 兼职工作多吗？我想快点找到工作，这样可以帮我承担生活开支。我在很多领域都
有工作经验。
(Are there plenty of part-time jobs? I want to find one as soon as possible so that it helps
me cover my living expenses. I have work experience in many different industries. )

7. Currently, you can apply for jobs as a waitress or in the kitchen in the facility centre.
Do you have any experience working in a café or a restaurant?
(目前你可以申请服务生的工作，或者在活动中心的厨房工作。你有在咖啡厅或者餐
厅工作的经验吗？)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

来看某大学Facility Centre 的定义：The University Facilities Centre (FSC) is
responsible for providing facility services, such as catering, room hire, cleaning,
waste removal, post and transport, building care and maintenance. 可以为学生提供
餐饮供应，场地/房屋租赁和清洁，设备维护，垃圾处理等等学生服务。

如果翻成“设施中心”，常用说法其实是“公共设施中心”。
8. 我在咖啡店做过服务员和帮厨。你可以多和我说说细节吗？或者我应该去浏览一
下学校的网站？
(I used to work as a waitress and a kitchen helper/a kitchen hand in a café. Could you tell
me more about it? Or should I take a look at the university website?)
9. I can give you some information and all the details are on the website. You can also
apply for jobs on the website.
(我可以给你提供一些信息。所有的详细信息都在网站上了。你也可以通过网站申
请工作。)
10. 那太好了，我今天晚些时候就去看看网站，顺便也申请一些适合我的工作。
(That’s great. I will take a look at the website later today and apply for some jobs that suit
me while I’m at it.)
11. Good luck. If you miss out on the jobs in the facility centre, you can keep looking on
the website. New jobs will be listed regularly.
(祝你好运。如果你错过了活动中心的工作，你可以持续关注网站。一直都会有新工
作放出来的。)

#70096. Council Cricket Club – Social
Briefing ：The following dialogue takes place between Marion, an English-speaking
council youth worker and a Mandarin-speaking parent. The parent has a son who likes
to play cricket and is keen to join a sports club. However, he’s worried that other boys
of his age may make fun of him because he’s never played cricket before. The dialogue
starts now.
1. Good morning. This is Marion speaking. I’m the council youth worker. How can I
help you today?
(早安。我是马利安，是市政厅的青少年照护者。我今天能如何帮到您呢？)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Youth workers 是做什么的呢？
Youth workers provide advocacy and serve as a role model for teenagers and
children, within a youth centre or program. Youth workers strive to build sustainable,
therapeutic relationships with disadvantaged or at-risk youth. They must be sensitive
to cultural and individual differences and needs. 所以中文可翻译为“青少年照护
者”。
2. 你好，马利安。我和我的家人才刚搬来这个区，我儿子非常想参加体育俱乐部。
(Hello, Marion. My family and I have just moved to this community and my son is keen
to join a sports club. )
3. There are several sports clubs operating in this area and I’m sure that there’s one
that suits your son. It depends on what sport he likes to play.
(这个区有好几个体育俱乐部，肯定能有适合您儿子的。也要看您儿子喜欢什么运动
啦。)
4. 他喜欢打板球。不过，他都十七岁了，他之前从来没有打过板球，他担心会跟不上
同龄的男孩子们。

(He likes to play cricket. However, he’s 17 years old and he’s never played it before.
He’s worried that he may fall behind other boys of his age.)
5. Don’t worry. We wouldn’t let him join the other boys if he’s not ready. He’s going to
learn some basic cricket skills before going for a match.
(别担心。您儿子没准备好之前，我们是不会让他跟其他的男孩子一起打的。我们也
会让他先学一些基础的板球技巧，再参加比赛。)
6. 那我就放心了。他总认为别人会取笑他。这边很多的男孩子都是从很小的的时候就
开始玩板球了。
(That’s a relief. He tends to think that others will make fun of him. Lots of boys here
started to play cricket at a young age.)
7. Yes, it is a very popular sport, but I think it is fine, other players are supportive and
the coach will not allow others to make fun of him.
(是啊，板球是一项很受欢迎的运动。不过我觉得没事的，球员们都很乐于助人，而
且教练也不会让别人取笑他的。)
8. 听你这么说就太好了。他很擅长运动，学东西还很快，只是他对于加入俱乐部和认
识新朋友有点紧张。
(I’m happy to hear that. He’s good at sports and he’s a quick learner. It’s just that he’s a
bit nervous about joining a club and meeting new friends.)
9. I understand that. If you like, I can give you a list of the clubs here. You also can give
the coach a call to make sure that beginners are welcome.
(我理解的。如果您需要的话，我可以给您一个俱乐部的名单。您还可以给教练打个
电话，确认一下他们是不是欢迎初学者。)
10. 这是个好主意。我想如果可以，我会在上这个课之前，先和教练聊一下。这样我儿
子会很高兴的。
(That’s a good idea. If possible, I think I’ll have a chat with the coach before the class. I
guess my son will be really glad. )

11. No problem. The list I gave you also contains the coach details and joining fee. Some
clubs also provide equipment, but I guess you might want to ask about it.
(没问题。我给您的单子上还有教练的信息和会费信息。有些俱乐部是提供设备的，
不过我想您可能想再问问。)
12. 这些信息十分有用！我一定会先问一下教练。谢谢你，马利安。我把这个表拿回家，
然后今天下午就打电话。
(This is very useful information! I’ll definitely check with the coach first. Thank you,
Marion. I’ll take the form home and make some calls this afternoon.)

#70097. Community Garden – Social
Briefing ：The
following
dialogue
takes
place
between
a
Mandarin-speaking
newly-arrived migrant and Brandon, an English-speaking community officer, who is
helping her make new friends and get involved in a community garden. The dialogue
starts now.、
1. Hi! This is Brandon, the community officer. I’ve never seen you before in this area.
You must be new here?
(您好，我是布莱登，是社区的工作人员。我之前从没在这个区见过您。您一定是新
来的吧？)
2. 你好，布莱登！是的。我刚搬来这个区没多久，不认识什么人。
(Hi, Brandon! Yes, I just moved here and I barely know anyone.)
3. Well, community center is a good place to meet new people. We also hold many
events throughout the year.
(嗯，社区中心很适合认识新朋友的。我们全年也都会组织很多活动。)
4. 太好了，这正是我期待的。我有两个孩子，都在这个区上学。所以大多数时间我一
般自己在家。我觉得有点寂寞。
(That’s great. That’s exactly what I was hoping for. I have two kids and they all go to
school here. Therefore, I usually spend most of the time alone at home and it can be a bit
lonely. )
5. Do you like gardening? Because there is a new community garden which was just
opened, and there may be some places available.
(您喜欢园艺吗？因为我们这刚新开了个社区花园，可能还有些空位呢。)
6. 我之前小的时候和我父母做过园艺，但是我很久没有住在有花园的房子了，我基本
都忘了。

(I did gardening with my parents when I was a kid. But it’s been a long time since I lived
in a place with a garden. I basically forget how to do everything.)
7. That doesn’t matter at all. The trainer will supervise you and will teach everyone
who would like to learn more.
(完全不用担心的。培训师会指导您的，也会对任何想多学点东西的人倾囊相授的/
不管是谁，只要愿意多学学，他都愿意教的。)
8. 哦, 好的, 那很好。在一开始我确实需要帮忙，如果有空的地方让我可以种花草，那
就真是太好了。
(Oh, okay, that’s great. I do need some help at the beginning. It would be great if there’re
spaces available for me to plant something.)
9. You can also meet a lot of new people. The garden manager is busy with holding a
number of events. It includes family-days and talks from gardening experts.
(您还能认识很多新朋友的。花园经理总忙活着组织一些活动，包括家庭日啊，园艺
专家讲座啊这些。)
10. 听起来很好玩，我孩子应该也喜欢，我想加入这个俱乐部，我要怎么申请呢？
(That sounds fun. I think my kids would also be interested. I want to join this club. How
do I apply for it?)
11. I could sign you up for it now. This is a short form that you need to fill in, and also
there is a brochure for you to read, which has all the gardening information.
(我现在就可以帮您报名。您需要填一个简单的表格，然后这有个小册子您可以读读
看，所有的园艺信息都在里面了。)
12. 谢谢你, 布莱登。我很期待可以学习如何种植，以及认识新朋友。
(Thank you, Brandon. I’m looking forward to learning how to plant and meeting new
friends.)
