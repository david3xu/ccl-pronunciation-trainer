是后来有一次，我走到我邻居家栅栏边上，看到他家后院连狗的水碗都没有。狗每
天一定渴坏了啊！
(At first, I always heard the dog barking. At that time, I thought the dog was being
disobedient, so I didn’t take it seriously. But then there was one time when I approached
my neighbor’s fence and saw that there wasn’t even a water bowl for the dog in the
backyard. The dog must be very thirsty every day!)
5. Well, that’s not a good thing. Actually, dogs need to have drinks available at all times.
Apart from this, have you noticed any other bad things?
(嗯，那可不太好。实际上，狗狗是需要随时有水喝的。除了这个，你还注意到其他
别的不好的事儿吗？)
6. 让我想想…有的。那只狗很大，但是特别瘦。我都能看见它的肋骨了。它的毛都发
黄了，还打结，一点光泽都没有。我感觉它的状态特别差。
(Let me see…yes, the dog is large but skinny. I can see its ribs. Its hair has got yellowed
and tangled. Its coat is very dull. I can feel it’s in a terrible condition.)
7. That’s terrible. You shouldn’t have been able to see its ribs. From what you have
told me, it seems that the dog is not in a good condition. I think you might be right:
the dog is being tortured.
(这实在太差了。你本不该能看见肋骨的。根据你给我讲的这些，似乎狗的情况很不
好。我觉得你说得没错：这只狗正在遭受折磨。)
8. 是啊，我的邻居从来不遛狗。其实我想过，去敲他家门，跟他聊聊狗的事儿。但是
我又怕我邻居不高兴，就打电话给你们了。
(Yes. My neighbor never walks his dog. I have actually planned to knock on his door and
talk with him about the dog. But I’m concerned that he might be upset. So I gave you this
call instead.)


遛狗：walk the dog
例句：Have you walked the dogs today? 你今天遛狗了吗？

Knock 搭配：Knock at/on sth: 敲；击
9. Well, to avoid any unnecessary trouble, it’s better not to approach your neighbor by
yourself. Anyway, I’ll write a report on this abuse case and we’ll send a protection
officer to visit him.
(嗯，为了避免不必要的麻烦，你最好不要自己去找你邻居。总之呢，我会就这次虐
狗事件写一个报告的，我们也会派保护专员去你邻居家。)
10. 好的。其实吧，我不想给我邻居惹麻烦。但是那只狗的情况实在太让人担心了。
(Okay. In fact, I’m not trying to get him into trouble. But the dog’s condition is just so
worrying.)
11. Actually, you don’t have to worry too much about it. If the dog hasn’t been
mistreated, then your neighbor won’t get into trouble. The protection officer will
simply provide him with some information about how to take good care of a dog.
(其实，你不用太担心这个。如果狗没有受到虐待，你邻居是不会惹上麻烦的。保护
专员只会给他提供一些怎么好好照顾狗的信息。)
12. 那还行。我希望保护专员赶快去他们家。我很高兴给你们打电话了。希望我能帮到
那只狗。
(That’s good. I hope the protection officer will visit him soon. I’m glad that I called.
Hope I can help the dog.)
13. Don’t worry. The officer will visit your neighbor in the next couple of days. If
anything gets worse or feels wrong, feel free to give us a call.
(别担心，保护专员接下来几天就会去你邻居家。如果情况有变更差，或者有觉得不
对劲的地方，请尽管给我们打电话。)
14. 我一定会的。真希望那只狗赶快好起来。谢谢您接听我的电话。

#70078. College course inquiry —Education
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a registrar Tony and a student
who just enrolled in the computer course. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hello. Welcome to our college. My name is Tony. How can I help you this morning?
(你好，欢迎来我们学校。我是托尼。今早我能如何帮到你呢？)
2. 你好，托尼。我刚进入你们的电脑课程。我有一些问题想问你。
(Hello, Tony. I have just enrolled in your computer course and I have some questions.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

A student has enrolled, 意思是a student signed up for a class

A student has been enrolled, 意思是Someone else signed a student up for a class.
3. Well done for being accepted by the college. I’m sure you’ll enjoy our computer
course. What questions do you want to ask?
(能被学校录取，真的太好啦。我想你一定会很喜欢我们的电脑课程的。你有哪些问
题呢？)
4. 我刚刚收到你们的电子邮件，上面有一个注册表格的链接，里面有两个开学日期。
但是，我不知道哪个才是对的。
(I just received your email. There’s a link to a registration form in the email and there are
two start dates. However, I’m not sure which one is correct.)
5. If you can give me the name of the course, I’ll check that for you. I’m sure you don’t
want to miss your first day.
(你把课程名字报给我吧，我帮你查一下。我想你肯定不想错过开学第一天的。)
6. 是呀，我真的非常期待学习这个课程。如果我错过了开学，那真的会很糟糕。我报
的是电脑和信息技术初级课程。

(Yes. I’m keen to this course. It will truly be a disaster if I miss the first day. The course I
signed up for is Computing and IT-Introductory.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Introductory：入门的，初步的
例：Introductory course：基础课程

“Computing and IT course”(原词)也是很多知名TAFE 的保留课程

最后有同学回忆的是“电脑和资讯课程”，如果大家听到这个，不用怀疑还是翻
“Computing and IT course”
7. There are two classes for this course. One is full time and the other is part time.
That’s why there are different start dates.
(这个课程有两种班型的。一种是全日制的，一种是非全日制的。所以开学日期不一
样啦。)
8. 哦，那我明白了。我报的是全日制课程。谢谢你。
(Okay, I see. The course I signed up for is full time. Thank you.)
9. You are very welcome. It can be confusing if there are two classes. What other
questions do you have?
(不客气的。同时有两种课程确实能让人很迷糊。你还有哪些其他的问题呢？)
10. 我想要了解一下学费的事情。请问我可以分期付款吗？
(I’d like to know about the tuition fee. Do you accept payment by instalments, if I may
ask?)
11. Yes, you can. Once you have filled in the registration form, you can go to the
financial office to arrange a payment plan.
(可以的。你填写好登记表以后，可以去财务办公室那边安排一下付款方案。)
12. 太好了。对我来说，分期付款比一次性付款容易很多。因为我在学习期间会做兼职

工作。
(That’s great. For me, payment by instalments can be much easier than a lump sum
payment, because I’ll work part time while I study.)
13. When you have completed your enrolment process, you’ll get a student account. You
can pay the tuition fee through the account. Also, your course information is listed
on it.
(你在办完入学手续以后，会拿到一个学生账号。你可以通过这个账号来交学费。另
外，你的课程信息也列在上面了。)
14. 听起来挺简单的，我现在就去填好登记表。谢谢你的帮助，托尼。
(That sounds simple. I’ll fill out the registration form now. Thanks for your help, Tony.)

#70079. A lost wallet - Legal

(你好，我今天能怎么帮到您呢？)
2. 你好。我捡到一个钱包，我想把它还给失主。
(Hello. I found a wallet and I’d like to return it to the owner.)
3. Okay. Based on the color of the wallet, I think the owner is a woman. Where did you
find it?
(好的。从钱包的颜色来看，我想失主是女性。您在那里找到钱包的呢？)
4. 在商场外面的人行道上。我当时有试着去找失主，但是当时那里一个人也没有。
(I found it on the sidewalk outside a shopping mall. I tried finding the owner but no one
was around at that time.)
5. Let’s see if there is any IDs in the wallet. That may help us to find the owner.
(我们看看钱包里有没有什么身份证件。这可能可以帮我们找到失主。)
6. 我之前把钱包打开过。当时我只想找到失主。我希望我没有做错事。
(I opened the wallet before. At that time, all I want was trying to find the owner. I hope I
did the right thing.)
7. You have done nothing wrong by opening it and trying to find an ID in it. Just
remember not to remove any stuff inside though.

(Nothing was taken. I gave you my word/I promise. I just want to find the owner of the
wallet.)
9. In that case, we usually keep the wallet in the Station. I hope the owner can claim it.
(这样的话，我们一般是把钱包放在警察局里保管。希望失主能来认领它。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Claim something: 认领; 索取
例句：A lot of lost property is never claimed.
10. 我也想在商场外贴布告帮助你们。这样失主如果看到，就知道钱包在哪。
(I want to help you by posting a notice outside the shopping mall. In that case, the owner
will know where to find the wallet after seeing it.)
11. There’s a notice board in the shopping center. Just don’t mention the color of the
wallet in case the wrong person claims it.
(购物中心里面有公告牌的。记得别提到钱包的颜色，以免其他人来认领。)
12. 好的。我就说，周二那天丢钱包的人，请到警察局去认领。
(Okay. I’ll just say “if you lost a wallet on Tuesday, please claim it at the Police Station’.)
13. Perfect. I hope the owner can claim it soon after seeing the notice. Please leave your
contact details here in case the owner wants to offer rewards for returning her
wallet.
(很好啊。我希望失主看到公告以后很快就能来认领。留一下你的联系方式吧，这样
如果失主想要答谢你帮她找回钱包的话，能联系上你。)
14. 我不想要什么答谢的。我只想把钱包还给失主。如果能找到失主，我一定会很开心
的。
(I don’t want rewards. I just want to return the wallet to the owner. I will be very happy if
we can find the owner.)

(That’s great. What does this class include? I want to learn more about how to manage
my budget. However, I don’t have much money. I’m only working part time now.)
7. Our class will teach you how to organize your budget and follow your budget. You
can save money every week.
(我们的课程会教你怎么管理和遵循预算。每周你都能攒下来钱的。)
8. 也许人们已经知道管理金钱很重要了。但是，澳大利亚的消费比我想象中的要高很
多啊。
(Perhaps people already know that it’s important to save money. However, the level of
spending/consumption in Australia is much higher than I imagined.)
9. Many people need to have some basic knowledge about managing money. Creating
budget is very important. You’ll find that you are not the only people who have this
concern. That’s the reason why we organize this course.
(很多人是需要有一些基础的理财知识的。有个预算是非常重要的。你会发现，不止
你一个人有这个担忧。这也是我们组织这个课程的原因。)

for work. I hope this course can help me achieve my goal/get what I want.)
