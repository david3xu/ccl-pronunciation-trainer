Briefing: The following dialogue takes place over the phone between Natalie, an

customer. The customer wants to make an enquiry about obtaining a business insurance
policy. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Good afternoon. My name is Natalie. What assistance could I provide to you today?
(下午好。我的名字是娜塔莉。今天我能帮您些什么呢？)
2. 你好，娜塔莉。我新买了一家咖啡店。我想买一份商业保险。
(Hello, Natalie. I just purchased a coffee shop. I’d like to purchase business insurance.)
3.
Congratulate you on buying a new business！We have a range of policies available,
especially ones that are designed for a small business.
(恭喜您买了新生意。我们有一系列的保单可供选择，尤其是针对小生意的保单。)
4. 这听起来很好呀。我想要确保如果店里起火了，或者是设备被偷了，我的生意是有
保障的。
(It sounds great! I’d like to make sure that if a fire breaks out in the shop or some
equipment is stolen, my business would be protected.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Equipment 不可数。
5. We have a basic small business insurance policy, which is very popular. It covers a
range of events, for example, fire and theft. And it is affordable.
(我们有一个基本小生意保单，很受欢迎。它可以承保一系列的意外事件，比如火灾
和盗窃。价格也是可以接受的。)

6. 我的预算不充裕。买得起的保险是很重要的。如果顾客在我的店里受伤了的话，这
个保险可以报销吗？
(My budget is tight. It’s important that the insurance is affordable. If a customer gets
injured in my shop, will the insurance cover that?)
7. It covers medical expenses to a certain amount. If you want to increase the level of
coverage, the cost will increase.
(这份保险可以承保一定数额的医疗费用。如果你想提高保险等级，费用会更高。)
8. 有一定额度的医疗报销就足够了。我还想投保一些设备，比如冰箱，咖啡机和我的
电脑。
(A certain amount of coverage is enough. I also want to get some equipment covered,
such as the fridge, the coffee machine and my computer.)
9. I’ll send you the policy detail. Please check the cover of those things. You can
increase the cover if you need.
(我把保单的详细信息发给您。您看一下这些东西保不保。如果您需要，您可以增加
投保内容。)
10. 这些很有用。我还想买一个运送食品的面包车。这个是包含在这个保险里的吗？
(Those are quite useful. I also want to buy a food delivery van. Will it be covered by this
insurance?)
11. I can help you with the business vehicle insurance, but it is separated from the
general insurance policy.
(我可以帮您看看商用车保险。但是它跟一般保险的保单是分开的。)
12. 好的。如果我买了商业保险，车辆保险有折扣吗？
(Okay. If I purchase this business insurance, will I get a discount on vehicle insurance?)

insurance policy from us.

3.
I definitely can help you with that. The most important thing is to make sure all the
windows and doors are closed when you leave.
(这个我肯定可以帮您。最重要的是确保您离开时所有的门窗都关好了。)
4.
我会的。不过我有点担心。我们街上一家上个月被盗了。我不想让它发生在我身上。
(I will. But I’m a bit concerned. One family in our street was burgled last month and I
don’t want that to happen to me.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

5.
Well, the thieves are not likely to break in the house if they don’t know you’ve left.
(嗯，如果小偷不知道你出门了，他们就不太可能闯进去。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

If someone, usually a thief, breaks in, they get into a building by force. (常指盗贼)

6.
这是一个好主意。但是我不知道怎么做，因为我要出去很长时间，至少六个月。
(This is a good idea. But I don’t know how to do it, because I will be away for a long
time, at least six months. )
7.
Well, you can ask the post officer who post mails to collect and keep them, instead of
sending them to the mailbox.
(嗯，你可以让寄信的邮递员把信取了存着，而不是放到信箱里。)
8.
我不知道可以这么做。如果邮箱里没有邮件，那么就会看起来我每天都在取邮件。
(I didn’t know I could do that. If there aren’t any mails in the mailbox, then it would look
like I collect mails every day.)
9.
Exactly. You can also ask your neighbor to mow the lawn. If the grass is very long,
the thieves will suspect that you’ve left.
(是啊。你还可以让邻居帮忙割草。如果草长太长了, 小偷就会怀疑你不在家。)
10. 我不在家的时候，邻居会喂猫，我可以问问她能不能帮我除草。
(My neighbor will feed the cat while I’m away. I could ask her if she could help me mow
the lawn.)
11. You can also ask your neighbor to park the car in the driveway. In this way, it seems
someone is in your house.
(你还可以让你的邻居把车停到车道上。这样看起来就好像是你家里有人。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

本段最后的回忆有缺失。
12. 这真是一个好主意。我的车停在车库，所以车道上有车位。你的建议真的很有帮助。
谢谢。
(This is really a good idea. My car is parked in the garage, so there are parking spaces in
the driveway. Your advice is really helpful. Thank you. )
