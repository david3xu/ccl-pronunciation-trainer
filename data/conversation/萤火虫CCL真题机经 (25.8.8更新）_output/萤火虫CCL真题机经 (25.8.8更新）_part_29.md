#70084. Struggling with lectures – Education
Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking University
student who is struggling with her lectures and an English-speaking lecturer. The
student is meeting the lecturer to ask for help. The dialogue starts now.
1. Good morning！Come in and have a seat. How can I help you today?
(早上好。请进来坐吧。今天我能怎么帮到你呢？)
2. 你好。我很担心我现在在学的社会工作这门课。我无法完成我的作业。因为我上课
的时候很难听懂。
(Hello. I’m quite worried about this social work course I’m studying. I can’t complete my
homework because it’s very difficult for me to understand the class. )
3. I’m glad you asked for help. I’m sure we can find a solution. Why do you feel it’s
difficult to understand?
(我很高兴你来寻求帮助了。我们一定能想办法解决的。你为什么觉得很难听懂呢？)
4. 英语是我的第二语言。大多数时候，我能听懂您讲的话。但是您说的快的时候，我
就会漏掉一些词。
(English is my second language. I can understand you most of the time. But I tend to miss
some words when you are speaking too fast.)
5. I see. Sorry I SPEAK too fast. I’ll try to slow down in the lecture. This may help you
TO keep up.
(原来是这样。抱歉我讲得有些快了。我会试着在课上讲慢一些的，这样可能可以帮
你跟上课程。)
6. 好的。当您讲新课题的时候，对我来说也很难。因为我不太熟悉您使用的语言。
(Okay. It’s also difficult for me when you’re talking about a new topic, because I’m not
quite familiar with the language you used. )

【萤火虫老师Tips】

Language 在表示“专门用语”这个意思的时候，不可数。
7. I can email you my notes before the lecture. In this way, you can make sure that you
have time to understand the language and content ahead of the lecture. Feel free to
ask me any questions if you need to.
(我可以在课前把我的笔记用邮件的形式发给你。这样的话，你可以确保在课前有时
间去提前了解一下里面的用语和内容。如果你需要的话，有问题也尽管问我。)
8. 太好了，谢谢。如果我不用担心上课能不能跟上的问题，我就能更专注于课程的内
容了。
(That’s great. Thank you. I can focus more on the lecture if I don’t have to worry about
whether or not I can keep up with it.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

If you keep up with something, you manage to do or understand all of it, or to do or
understand it as well as other people.
9. You can also record the lecture. In this way, you can have the notes as well as the
recording. You can also record the class discussion and any questions your
classmates come up with.
(你也可以把课程录下来。这样的话，你又有笔记，又有录下来的课程。你还可以把
课堂讨论和任何你同学们提出的问题都录下来。)
10. 这是个好主意。我可以在上课前看笔记，上课的时候把课程录下来，课后再去听。
这样的话，我就不会错过重要的内容了。
(This is a good idea. I can read the notes in advance, record the lecture when I’m having
it and listen to the recording afterwards. In this way, I won’t miss anything important.)
11. You might also find it helpful to join the class discussion group in the library every
Wednesday. I’ll email you the details.

(每周三在图书馆有课程讨论小组，你可能也会觉得有帮助的。我把详细信息也发邮
件给你。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

这里也有同学回忆的是Wednesday noon, 多了一个中午。如果考到这个对话，
这里要仔细听。
12. 噢！我还不知道有这个学习小组呢。我一定会参加的。谢谢您所有的建议。我之前
还很担心我完成不了这门课呢。
(Oh! I didn’t know about this study group. I’ll definitely be there. Thank you for all your
advice. I was quite worried that I might not be able to complete this course. )

the factory. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hello, welcome to your first day here. I’m Glenn, the training officer of the factory.

2. 你好，格伦，我很高兴来到这。我希望我今天就能开始工作。
(Hello, Glenn. I’m glad to be here. I hope I can start today.)
3. Great. The first thing you need to do is to get your uniform from the uniform
department. You should get five uniforms as a start.
(很好。首先你需要先去制服部门领制服。你先拿五套。)
4. 我需要买制服吗？我不知道这个是怎么操作的。我之前工作的地方从来没有穿过制
服。

5. No, you don’t need to buy your uniforms. It’s provided by the factory. The uniform
department will replace your uniforms if they are worn out or damaged.
(不，你不用付钱。制服是工厂提供的。如果制服磨损或者损坏了，制服部门都会给
换的。)
6. 好的。我记住了。在面试的时候，经理说我要进行一个培训。我什么时候能开始呢？
(Okay, I’ll keep that in mid. When I was having the interview, the manager said that there
would be a training. When will it start? )
7. As soon as you put on your new uniform. I will be your training supervisor while
you’re learning.
(你换好制服以后就可以开始了。在你培训期间，我会是你的培训监督师。)
8. 我很高兴您是我的培训师。我希望我不用在一天内把工作全学完。我想我需要更多
的时间。
(I’m glad that you are my training supervisor. I hope that I don’t have to learn everything
within a day. I think I need more time.)
9. We don’t expect you to learn everything within 1 day. The training program will last
for two weeks. I think there’s enough time for you to settle in.
(我们没有要你一天就学会所有的内容。培训项目会持续两周。我想你是有足够的时
间适应的。)
10. 谢谢。两周的话我就放心多了。我会尽快学习，努力工作。我希望我能把工作做好。
(Thanks. That’s a huge relief if it lasts (for) 2 weeks. I’ll try to be a quick learner and
work hard. I hope I can do a good job.)
11. We like enthusiastic employees. I’m pretty sure you can do well. I’ll be supervising
you until you are ready to work on your own. The most important thing to learn is
safety.
(我们也很喜欢有热情的员工呢。我相信你一定能做好的。直到你准备好可以独立工

作之前，我都会一直带着你的。你要学的最重要的一件事就是注意安全。)
12. 我明白了。我会特别注意安全的。如果您准备好了，我们就开始吧。

Briefing:
The
following
dialogue
takes
place
over
the
phone
between
an
English-speaking employee of a local community centre and a Mandarin-speaking
parent who has difficulty paying the bills. The parent is calling to ask for help. The
dialogue starts now.
1. Good afternoon. Thanks for calling the community centre. How can I help you?
(下午好。感谢致电社区中心。我能如何帮到您呢？)
2. 你好。我的女儿生病了，我没有足够的钱来给她买药，支付账单跟买食物。
(Hello. My daughter is sick. I don’t have enough money to buy her medicine, pay the
bills or buy any food.)
3. I’m sure we can find a way to help. I’m sorry to hear that your daughter is sick. I
hope she recovers soon.
(我确定我们可以想到办法来帮你的。抱歉听到你女儿生病了。我希望她能早点康
复。)
4. 她需要服药三个月。为了支付她的医药费，我都在做兼职工作以便照顾她。但是钱
还是不够付清全部的账单。
(She needs to be on medication for three months. I’m working part time so that I can
cover her medical expenses and take care of her. But the money is still not enough to
cover all the bills. )
5. I understand. It must BE difficult to manage money when there’s extra medical
costs.
(我能理解。有额外的医药费开销的时候，把钱管理好一定很困难吧。)
6. 我只能选择先付最重要的费用，像是医药费跟房租。有时候电费跟电话费我都没办
法付了。我担心这些服务会被停掉。

(I have to pay the most important ones first, like her medical expenses and our rent.
Sometimes I’m not even able to pay our electricity and phone bills. I’m worried that
those services may be turned off.)
7. The electricity and mobile company can make a payment plan for you, so you have
more time to pay. Just give them a call and explain your situation.
(电力和电话公司可以帮你制定付款计划的，这样你就能有更多的时间去交费了。你
只需要给他们打个电话，解释一下你的情况就好。)
8. 我不知道还可以这样做。如果有更多时间来付款的话，就简单多了。
(I didn’t know that’s an option. It would be much easier if I have more time.)
9. You can also buy groceries at our food warehouse. We provide fresh packed food
which is cheaper for families experiencing financial difficulties.
(你还可以在我们的食品仓库买杂货。对于有经济困难的家庭，我们是有价格更低的
新鲜包装食品提供的。)
10. 谢谢你。要给家人准备好的三餐真的不容易。我也担心我的女儿会吃不好。
(Thank you. It’s not easy to prepare three decent meals for the family. I’m also worried
that my daughter can’t eat well.)
11. All you need to do is to show us your health care card. Then you can purchase them
from us at a cheaper price than those in the supermarket.
(您只需要跟我们出示一下您的保健卡, 然后您就可以用比超市低的价格在我们这
儿买东西啦。)
12. 我明天可以去仓库吗？我这周的食物已经不多了。
(May I go to the warehouse tomorrow? I don’t have enough food left for this week.)
13. It’s closed tomorrow. It only opens three times a week. But if you come to the centre
tomorrow, I can organize an emergency service for you including a food parcel.

daughter. The dialogue starts now.
1. Hi. My name is Sally. I am your daughter’s teacher. It’s very nice to meet you.
(你好，我是莎莉。我是你女儿的老师。很高兴见到你。)
2. 你好，莎莉，很高兴見到你。我有点担心你为什么要见我呢?
(Hello, Sally. It’s nice to meet you. I’m a bit worried about why you asked to see me.)
3. Nothing bad. Your daughter settled in quite well. I just want to talk with you about
her mathematics skills. She seems to be struggling in this area.
(没什么坏事。你的女儿适应得挺好的。我就是想跟你谈谈她的数学能力。她在这方
面似乎有些困难。)
4. 好的，原来是这样。我知道她不喜欢数学。每天晚上，她总是把数学作业放到最后
才做。我没意识到数学对她来说这么难。
(Okay, I see. I know that she’s not keen on math. She always leaves her math homework
to the last minute every evening. I didn’t realize that math is so difficult for her.)
5. Knowing that she is not keen on math will not help. I want to talk with you to see if
we can find a way to give her some extra support.
(知道她不喜欢数学这一点，对她并没有帮助。我想跟你聊聊，看看能不能找到办法
来多帮帮她。)
6. 我愿意尽我所能去帮她。我知道数学对她是非常重要的。我也不希望她落后于班上
其他同学。

don’t want her to fall behind her classmates.)
