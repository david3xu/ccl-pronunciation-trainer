7. It will be helpful if you can sit with her every night and supervise her homework. We
will arrange a teacher’s aide, 1 on 1 during the class for her.
(如果您可以每个晚上陪她一起坐下来，看着她写作业，就可以帮到她。我们会安排
一个教学助理，在课上一对一地帮助她。)
8. 听起来真好，莎莉。我會尽力帮她的。但是我的数学也不怎么好啊。
(That sounds really good, Sally. I’ll try my best to help her. But I’m not really good at
math either.)
9. Don’t worry. I am sure you will be fine at that level. She will improve quickly with
such extra help.
(别担心。那个程度的数学你肯定没问题的。有了额外的帮助，她会进步得很快的。)
10. 太棒了，你觉得她是否需要课后辅导吗? 我知道学校的其他小朋友都有请家教。
(That’s great. Do you think she needs after-school tutoring? I know that all the other kids
at school have tutors. )
11. I don’t think she needs that yet. We will review her progress a few months later, and
then make a decision. She is certainly doing well in other subjects.
(我觉得她还不需要。我们过几个月再看一下她的进度，然后再定吧。她其他的科目
都很不错的。)
12. 这听起来是个不错的计划。非常感谢你莎莉，我真的很感激。
(That sounds like a good plan. Thank you very much Sally. I really appreciate it.)
