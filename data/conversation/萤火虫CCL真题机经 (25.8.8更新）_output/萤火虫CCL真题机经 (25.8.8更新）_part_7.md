10. Mr. Jin：没有，那我就带他去做检查吧。最后这一栏，是让我在上面签字是吗？
(No. I’ll take him to do those tests then. As for the last column，I should sign it, right?)
11. Doctor：That’s correct. This is a medical treatment consent form. It will authorize
the teachers in charge at the camp to take any necessary medical procedures in the
case of emergency, provided that they can’t contact you.
(是的。这是个治疗同意书。有紧急情况发生时，如果联系不上你，它可以让野营的
负责老师有权启动任何必要的医疗程序。)
12. Mr. Jin：原来如此。谢谢您的讲解。那您帮我们预约验血吧。谢谢您。
(I see. Thank you for explaining it to me. Please make an appointment for us regarding
the blood test then. Thank you.)

#70015. Intercom Repair - Housing
Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between Mrs. Li, a mandarin speaking lady,
and Jean, an English-speaking housing service officer regarding the repair of a broken
intercom. The dialogue starts now.
1.
Jean：Good morning, this is Jean from community housing service. How can I help
you today?
(早上好，我是小区物业服务处的珍。今天我能帮您些什么呢？)
2.
Mrs. Li：早上好，我叫李桂英。我家楼下入口的对讲机坏了两个月了。我也报修过
了。但是一直都没有人来修。
(Good morning. My name is Guiying Li. The intercom at the entrance of my building
stopped working two months ago. I have reported/asked for repair/put in a repair request,
but no one ever showed up.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Intercom，对讲机，对讲系统，火车里其实每节车厢都有
3.
Jean：I see. Did you report it by giving us a call or by talking to us in person? Do you
have a customer reference number?
(我了解了。您报修的时候是给我们打的电话，还是亲自来找的我们呢？您有客户参
考编号吗？)
4.
Mrs. Li：我是打电话报修的。确实你们的工作人员给了我一个编号。让我看看，是
F3872。我家在二楼，我腿脚又不利索，没有对讲机真的很不方便。
(I gave you a call. Your people did give me a number. Bear with me…it’s F3872. I live
on the second floor. My legs are not working properly/smoothly/I have mobility issues
and it’s really not convenient without the intercom.)

5.
Jean：I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Let me check our records first. Can I confirm
that the building is Unit 6, 56 Bond Street, Parramatta?
(对于给您带来的不便，我很抱歉。让我先看看我们的记录。是巴拉玛塔区，邦德街
56 号的6 单元吗？)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Convenient这个词的用法补充下，“如果你方便”，记得不要说If you are convenient,
而是If it’s convenient for you
6.
Mrs. Li：是的没错。我8 月5 号报修的。因为8 月3 号是我74 岁生日，我朋友来
给我庆祝，结果我没办法给他们开门。我记得很清楚。
(Yes. I reported on the fifth of August. August the third was my 74th birthday and my
friends came to celebrate for me. I was not able to open the door for them. I remember
that clearly.)
7.
Jean：Congrats on your birthday! Well, I can see from the system that we did send a
handyman to repair the intercom. He contacted you twice, yet it seems you didn’t
pick up his calls. Have you changed your phone number?
(祝贺您啦！嗯，我可以从系统里看到，我们确实派了一名杂务工去修对讲机。他联
系了您两次，但是似乎您没有接他的电话。您换电话号码了吗？)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Handyman，非常Aussie 澳式的一个词，什么都能做，主要管修理东西，可以说
杂务工
8.
Mrs. Li：电话号码我是不会换的，要不然朋友找不着我了。不过我可能确实没有接
他的电话，我看到是个不认识的号码，以为是推销的。你知道现在好多推销的人实
在太烦了，接了电话简直就别想挂电话。

(I won’t change my phone number because otherwise my friends would not be able to
reach me. However, it was possible that I didn’t pick up his call. I saw it was a new
number and I thought it was a telemarketer. You know, many of them are so annoying.
You can never hang up after you pick up their calls.)
9.
Jean：I totally understand. I will arrange our contractor to fix the intercom. His
name is John Brown. His number is 0401 247 638. You may want to save his number
this time. I’ll make an appointment for you now. What about next Monday
morning？
(我完全理解的。我会安排我们的合同工去修对讲机的。他的名字是约翰布朗。他的
电话号码是0401 247 638。这次您也许需要把他的电话号码存起来啦。我现在再帮
您预约一下吧。下周一早上让他来怎么样？)
10. Mrs. Li：早上可能不行，那天早上我要去医院，下午要去学校接孙子放学。
(Morning is probably not okay. I have to go to the hospital that morning and I need to
pick up my grandson from school that afternoon.)
11. Jean：Well, I’ll put this in the system. What about 12:30? John will contact you an
hour before he arrives. Is that okay for you?
(嗯，我会在系统里标注一下的。那12:30 呢？约翰会在到之前提前一小时联系您的。
可以吗？)
12. Mrs. Li：好的，到时候我会在家等着的。谢谢你耐心的帮助。再见。
(Okay. I’ll wait at home then. Thank you for your patience. See you.)

officer and a mandarin speaking person, Jimmy Huang regarding his son’s parole. The

1.
Jane：Good Morning, Mr. Huang. I’m Jane and I’m a probation and parole officer.
I’m here to do a home visit and discuss your son Tony.
(早上好，黄先生。我是简，是一名缓刑和假释官。我今天是来做家访的，并且要跟
你讨论一下你儿子托尼的事情。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Probation 缓刑；Parole 假释；bail 保释
2.
Mr. Huang：警官你好，请进吧。请问我儿子Tony 在监狱一切都还好吗？
(Hello, officer. Please come in. Is everything in prison okay for Tony, if I may ask?)
3.
Jane：Don’t worry, he’s fine. His parole has been granted. He gave this address to us
before his trial as his residential address. After he’s release, is he going to live here
with you?
(别担心。他很好。他的假释已经被批准了。在他庭审之前，他把这个地址作为他的
居住地址给了我们。在他释放以后，他会跟你一起住在这吗？)
4.
Mr. Huang：这是他的家，所以他当然还会住在这里。我们能去监狱接他吗？还有
什么是我们能做的吗？我们一定尽力配合。
(This is his home, so he will live here for sure. Can we pick him up in prison? Is there
anything else we could do? We’ll definitely try our best to cooperate.)

Jane：You need to pick him up. Now I need to inspect his room and the house. After
he’s released, he will need to wear an electronic monitoring device on his ankle all
times so that we can track his location.
(你需要去接他。现在我需要检查他的房间和这个房子。在他释放以后，他需要一直
在脚踝上佩戴一个电子监控设备，以便我们追踪他的定位/位置。)
6.
Mr. Huang：好的。我给您带路，这是他的房间，他有自己的电视，电脑。他会一
个人好好住在这里。我们说什么也不会再让他的狐朋狗友来找他了。
(Okay. I’ll show you the way. This is his room. He has his own TV and computer. He
will live here obediently, just himself. We’ll never allow his bad friends to come and visit
him anymore.)
7.
Jane ：Good. He also needs to abide by the conditions attached to his parole,
including a curfew, which means he can’t leave the premise between 9pm to 5am.
(很好。他还需要遵守他的假释附带的条件，包括宵禁，也就是说从晚上九点到早上
五点之间，他不得离开住所。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Condition 在此处是条件的意思
比如根据你的签证条件：according to the conditions of your visa
想一想网站上跳出来的小页面会写着：Terms and conditions—T&C 条款和条件,
就是那一堆小字部分(英文叫fine print，也可以翻成细则，在我们的business 单
词表上)，让你点agree，不agree 就不能跳到下一步的那个弹窗。
8.
Mr. Huang：好的，我们也会监督他的。那他白天可以离开家，是吗？他能工作吗？
我表弟可以找个砌砖的活儿给他做，别让他太闲了。
(Okay. We’ll also supervise him. He can leave home during the day, right? Can he work?
My cousin can find a brick-laying job for him to keep him busy.)

Jane：Yes, he can work. Though we’ll need the full details of your cousin. Apart
from that, Tony needs to report to his parole officer on a regular basis.
(是的，他可以工作的。不过我们需要你表弟的所有信息资料。除此之外，托尼还需
要定期向他的假释官报告。)
10. Mr. Huang：好的，我跟我表弟说说，他一定会理解的。还有，警察会定期来检查
我儿子吗？我怕邻居们说闲话。
(Okay. I’ll talk with my cousin. I’m sure he’ll understand. Also, will the police check on
my son regularly? I’m worried that the neighbors will gossip.)
11. Jane：According to the Adult Parole Board, the officer will show up unannounced to
check on him as he has been charged with drug trafficking.
It’s a very serious
crime.
(根据成人假释委员会的规定，假释官来检查他是不会事先通知的。这是因为他被指
控贩毒。这是非常严重的罪行。)
12. Mr. Huang：天呐，真不敢相信我的儿子会跟毒贩扯上关系。真是羞耻啊。但是不
管怎样，我们还是爱他的，毕竟是我们的亲生儿子。
(Gosh！I can’t believe my son could be related to a drug dealer! I feel so ashamed. But no
matter what, we’ll still love him. After all, he’s our own son.)

secondary college teacher. They are having a parent-teacher interview. The dialogue
starts now.
1.
Parent：老师您好，您叫我来开家长会有什么急事吗？我最近工作很忙的。
(Hello. You asked me for this parent-teacher interview. Is there anything urgent? I’ve
been really busy with work recently.)
2.
Teacher：I’m sorry to tell you that your son seems to have some problems with study
recently. He failed his chemistry and physics examinations.
(很遗憾地告诉您，您儿子最近似乎学习上有些问题。他的化学和物理考试都没有及
格。)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Physics 物理课

Physical Education 体育课也就是我们小时候学的PE
3.
Parent：天啊，这真是晴天霹雳。我儿子在家说过这两门学起来很困难。他在课上
认真听讲吗？
(Gosh! It’s so shocking/ it's such shocking news/ it's a bolt out of the blue! My son said
at home that these two subjects were difficult to learn. Does he listen carefully in class?)
4.
Teacher：Well, that’s another thing I want to discuss with you about. It seems that
he finds it difficult to concentrate in class. I often find him absent-minded or even
dozing off.
(嗯，这是我想跟您讨论的另一件事。他似乎很难在课上集中注意力。我总看到他开
小差，甚至打瞌睡。)

5.
Parent：除了课上走神开小差，打瞌睡，他还会在课上跟同学说话，打扰别人吗？
如果他上课好好听讲，成绩有可能提高吗？
(Apart from being absent-minded and dozing off in class, does he talk to his classmates
or disturb others? Would his grades increase if he listens carefully in class?)
6.
Teacher：If he could stay more focused and talk less in class, there’s still room for
improvement. He also needs to finish his homework on time.
(如果他可以在课上更集中注意力，少讲话的话，他的成绩就还有提高的空间。他还
需要按时完成作业。)
7.
Parent：真是惭愧啊，我和孩子父亲最近工作太忙了，都没顾得上管他。今天回家
我会跟他好好谈一谈的。我保证他按照老师您说的去做。
(I feel really ashamed. His father and I have been too busy with work recently to have
time for him. I’ll have a good talk with him today after I get back. I promise he’ll do as
you asked.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

一般shameful 表示羞耻，或者shame on you 为你感到羞耻；其他时候都是惭愧
居多
8.
Teacher：I'm glad to hear that. We can have another parent-teacher interview next
month to update his progress. I hope we can work together to improve his academic
performance.
(很高兴听到这个。下个月我们可以再开一次家长会来跟进一下他的情况。我希望我
们可以一起努力，把他的学习成绩提上来。)
9.
Parent：好的老师，我会找我侄子再给他补习补习物理化学的。我侄子大学学的就
是物理专业，之前也是精英学校的好学生。

(Okay. I’ll ask my nephew to tutor him in physics and chemistry. Physics is his major at
his university. He also used to be a good student at a selective school.)
【萤火虫老师Tips】

Tutor someone in some subjects 辅导某人某门课
10. Teacher：That’s good. I also suggest you have a good talk with him regularly, often
ask him how he is doing and show him that you care deeply about him.
(那很好。我还建议你们跟他定期好好聊一聊，经常问问他最近怎么样，让他知道你
们非常关心他。)
11. Parent：老师您说的对，这个年纪的青少年多少都有些叛逆。我们会好好关心他，
督促他。
(You are right. Teenagers at this age can be more or less rebellious. We’ll take good care
of him and encourage him.)
12. Teacher：Great. Please feel free to contact me if you have any problems.
(很好。如果你们有任何问题，请尽管联系我。)
