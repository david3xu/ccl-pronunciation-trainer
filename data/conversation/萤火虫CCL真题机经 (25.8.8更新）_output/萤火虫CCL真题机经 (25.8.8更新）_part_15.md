from the place I work. Commuting is very inconvenient. I was wondering if I could get

replace your items. However, you need to pay the excess fee.

Good morning. Welcome to Centrelink. What can I do for you today?

you work?
(我了解了。嗯，现在这情况很复杂了。他是你们家里收入的唯一来源吗？还是你也
工作呢？)
8.
没有，我不工作，因为我们有三个孩子，而且托儿服务也是很贵的。我丈夫是临时
工，所以他生病了是没有收入的，也没有带薪病假。
(No, I don’t work because we have three kids and child care is also quite expensive. My
husband is a casual worker, so he won’t get paid or have any paid sick leave when he’s
sick.)

Leave 表示假期时，不可数。
9.
So you don’t have any incomes now. I can see you are on family tax benefit for your
children, so you’re already in our system.
(所以你们现在没有任何收入了。我看到你们正在领取给孩子的家庭税收福利金/优
惠，所以你们已经在我们的系统里了。)

是啊。这真是头痛。有很多方面需要考虑。不过，最让人关心的是孩子能从学校学
到什么。
(Yes. This gives us headaches. We need to think carefully in so many ways. But what we
care most about is what our kid could learn from a school.
)
7.
When your daughter came to the school on our open day, the form she filled in
states that she particularly likes art, which is one of our school’s strong points.
(您女儿开放日来我们学校时，填写的表格里说她特别喜欢艺术。艺术是我们学校的
强项之一。)
8.
我先生是室内设计师, 她可能是被父母影响到了。她特别喜欢艺术。那你能告诉我
学校具体有哪些艺术课程吗？
(My husband is an interior designer. She’s probably influenced by her parents. She really
likes art. Then could you tell me what specific art programs you have here?)
9.
Apart from drawing, sculpture, and design, which you may have seen on our open
day, we also provide photography programs. We also have a teacher who is
specialized in Chinese ink and water painting.
(除了绘画，雕塑和设计这些你可能在开放日看过的，我们还有摄影课。我们还有一
位专长中国水墨画的老师。
10. 那你们的数学怎么样呢？考虑到作为艺术家，维持生计或许会很困难, 如果艺术可
以结合其他实用的课程，她的前途就有保障了。
(Then what about your Math? Given that it may be difficult to make a living as an artist,
she could have a secured future if there are some other practical programs on top of art.)
11. Actually, our school is also very good at math and science. Last year, our school
team won the first place of the State’s science competition.
(其实我们学校的数学和科学都非常好。去年我们校队拿了州科学竞赛的第一名。)
12. 那太好了！这是很好的成绩。作为校长，你一定很自豪吧？
