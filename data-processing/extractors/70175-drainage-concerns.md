#70175. Drainage Concerns - Business

1.
Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Streamline Drainage Services. This is Marion, one of the drainage specialists here. How can I help you today?
下午好，感谢致电顺流排水服务。我是马里恩，这边的一位排水专家。今天我能帮您些什么？

2.
下午好，我家的排水有问题，我朋友推荐我给您打电话求助。
Good afternoon. I'm having some drainage issues at my place, and a friend recommended that I call you for help.

3.
Well, we always appreciate referrals from happy customers! Could you tell me more about the drainage problem you're experiencing?
嗯，我们一直都很感激满意客户的推荐。您能再说说遇到了什么排水问题吗？

4.
我住在这个房子里两年了，之前一直都没问题。但是最近遇到了积水问题，而且情况越来越糟了。
I've been living in this house for two years, and it had always been fine. But recently, I've been having a water pooling problem, and it's getting worse.

5.
That doesn't sound good. There are a lot of possible causes. Can you give me more details?
听起来不太妙。有可能导致积水的原因有很多，能跟我具体描述一下吗？

6.
我家后花园的地势是向房子这边倾斜的。下大雨的时候，雨水会顺着坡流下来，积攒在房屋周围。
My back garden slopes toward the house. When it rains heavily, the water runs down the slope and pools around the house.

7.
I see. If the flooding only started recently, there must have been some changes around your property.
明白了。如果积水是最近才出现的，那周围环境一定发生了什么变化。

8.
既然您提到了这一点，我家后面同一地块的邻居最近几周一直在装修。
Now that you mention it, the neighbor on the same lot behind my house has been renovating for the past few weeks.

9.
That's interesting. It could definitely be related, especially if they've added something like a deck or made changes to the landscape of the yard.
有意思。这很可能有关系，尤其是如果他们加盖了像是露台这样的东西，或者改动了院子的地形。

10.
听起来您很了解这方面的问题，我能请您过来帮我看看出了什么问题吗？
You sound like you really know your stuff. Would you be able to come over and take a look?

11.
Of course. We need to identify the exact problem before figuring out the best solution. Hopefully, it'll be an easy fix.
当然。我们得先找出问题的根源，才能决定最好的解决方案。希望这个问题好处理。

12.
我也是这样希望的。如果您明天有空，我明天一整天都在家。您随时过来都可以。
I hope so too. If you're available tomorrow, I'll be home all day, so you can come anytime.

13.
Unfortunately, I'm not available tomorrow, but I can come the day after if that works for you.
很抱歉，明天我不行，但后天可以，不知道您方便吗？

14.
好的，后天可以的。谢谢您这么快就能过来排查问题。我真希望在此期间不会再下雨了。
Alright, the day after tomorrow works for me. Thanks for coming over so quickly to check things out. I really hope it doesn't rain again before then.
