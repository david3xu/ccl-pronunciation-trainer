#70002. Home Visit Cleaning Support - Social Welfare

1.
Good morning. I am David Smith. I am coming to do a home visit.
早上好！我叫David Smith。今天过来想做一个上门访问。

2.
你好，史密斯先生。请进。
Hello, Mr. Smith. Please Come in.

3.
Thank you. The government cleaning support provides the housing cleaning for the aged people. I just want to ask you, what are you concerned about most when cleaning house.
谢谢您！政府清洁支持计划为老年人提供房屋清洁服务。我只是想问一下您最担心的房子清洁问题是什么？

4.
我年纪大了。很多活都做不动了。我需要有人帮我收拾家里。我很想让我的地毯有人清洁。因为房子的年限也老了，地毯看起来总是不干净。
I'm old and I'm not capable of doing most of the housework anymore. I need someone to help me tidy up the house. I really want my carpets cleaned as well, because the house is also old and the carpets always look dirty.

5.
Ok, I will write this down and we will get someone to do the vacuum cleaning for you.
好的，我把这个记下来。而且，我们会找人帮你吸尘。

6.
太感谢了。我不喜欢尘土太多，因为我有哮喘。
Thank you so much! I do not like it when there is too much dust because I have asthma.

7.
How about other parts of the house? Do you need someone to do the kitchen or the bathroom for you?
那房子的其他地方呢？需要有人为您打扫厨房或浴室吗？

8.
是的，最好也有人能帮我把厨房、卫生间、浴室弄干净。如果你们方便的话，能不能也找人来帮我打理一下花园，顺便帮我把前院的草除一下?
Yes, it would be better if someone could help me clean my kitchen, toilet and bathroom. If it is convenient for you, could you also get someone to do the gardening and meanwhile weed the front yard while they are at it?

9.
Yes, I will write this down, but I am not quite sure whether gardening services will be part of this government program.
是，我会记下来。但我不太确定园艺服务是不是政府计划的一部分。

10.
好的，谢谢你们。你们这个服务真是太好了。
Ok, thank you! This service is wonderful!

11.
You are welcome. That's what we are here for. Any other cleaning parts that concern you?
不客气。这是我们的工作。您还有什么其他关于清洁的问题吗？

12.
对了，我的窗户也不太干净。去年圣诞的时候，我本来想做大扫除，但是上面的窗户太高了，我差点摔下来。
Yes, my windows are quite dirty too. Last Christmas, I was going to do a thorough clean, but the top window's so high that I almost fell down/off.

13.
Yes, I can see you have a really big window. And it is really dangerous for you to climb up and clean the top one.
是，我能看到您有一扇很大的窗户。爬上去清洁上面的那一扇是很危险的。

14.
太感谢你们了，目前没有其他事情了。
Thank you very much, there is nothing else at the moment/that's all for now.
