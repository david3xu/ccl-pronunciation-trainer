#70179. Stolen Tools Report - Legal

1.
Hello, this is the police assistance hotline. How can I help you?
你好，这里是警方协助热线。我能帮您什么忙？

2.
你好，我不知道我是否打对了电话号码。我想报案。
Hello, I'm not sure if I dialled the right number. I'd like to report a crime.

3.
OK. You called the right number. There is a different number if you need to report something very serious.
好的，您打对了。如果您要报非常严重的案件，会有另一个号码。

4.
好的，不是特别严重的事，但对我来说很重要，没有人有危险，不是很严重。
Alright, it's not extremely serious, but it's important to me. No one is in immediate danger.

5.
That's good. I understand all sorts of crime can affect the victim. Let's take the crime report.
那就好。我知道各种犯罪都会影响受害者。我们来记录案情吧。

6.
谢谢，保险公司让我报警, 才能申请理赔。
Thank you. My insurance company told me to report the crime before filing a claim.

7.
Understood. Please describe the incident in detail.
明白。请详细描述事发经过。

8.
我是建筑工人，在工地上班。我停在工地的车被撬了，工具全被偷了。我简直不敢相信。
I'm a construction worker, working on a site. My car parked at the site was broken into, and all my tools were stolen. I just can't believe it.

9.
Sorry to hear that. Tools, especially power tools, are always common targets for thieves since they can sell them online or to shops.
听到这个消息我感到非常抱歉。工具，尤其是电动工具，总是小偷盯上的常见目标，因为他们可以把工具在网上卖掉，或者卖给商店。

10.
如果小偷把他们卖到商店，警察可能会找到，和其他人一样，我在上面刻了信息。这样能帮助追查吗？
If the thief sells them to shops, the police might trace them. Like many others, I had my details engraved on them. Will that help tracking/ Will that help with the investigation?

11.
Excellent precaution! This significantly improves recovery chances. We'll do our best to investigate the incident and recover your property if possible.
这个预防措施很好。能大大提高找回几率。我们会尽力调查此事，并在可能的情况下追回您的财物。

12.
我买了保险是很好的。即使没有找到，也可以向保险公司申请理赔。我的保险涵盖盗窃损失，但需要案件编号，才能启动理赔。
It's great that I have insurance; even if nothing is recovered, I can still file a claim with my insurer. My insurance covers theft losses, but I need a case number to initiate the claim.

13.
Yes. We still need more details about the crime. Please provide any additional information you can remember. Then I'll fill out the official report and email it to you for your claim.
是的，我们还需要更多关于案件的细节。请把你能记得的其他信息提供给我，然后我会把正式报案记录填写好，并通过邮件发给你，好让你申请理赔。

14.
好的，谢谢您的帮助。我再仔细回想一下，如果我能想起来任何别的细节，我再跟您联系。
Alright, thank you for your help. I'll think it over carefully, and if I recall any additional details, I'll get back to you.
