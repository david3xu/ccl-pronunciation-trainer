#70203. Government Legal Helpline for Fence Dispute - Legal

1.
Good afternoon, you've reached the Law Information Helpline. What legal issue can I help you with today?
下午好，您已拨通法律信息热线，请问今天有什么法律问题我可以帮您解答？

2.
下午好，我这边有件事想请教，但不知道该怎么开口说起。
Good afternoon. I've got an issue I need help with, but I'm not sure how to get started.

3.
That's fine. I can explain your options and refer you to a lawyer who can take your case if you need one.
没问题——我可以给您提供一些信息，如果需要，我也能帮您推荐一位律师。

4.
能告诉我推荐的律师是谁吗？这样可能也不错。不过我想先了解一下推荐费是多少。
Could you tell me the lawyer's name? That sounds not bad—but first, I'd like to know how much a referral costs.

5.
Actually, we're a government service. Our legal information and referrals are free. You won't owe us a cent unless you engage a lawyer.
事实上，我们是政府部门，提供免费法律信息和推荐服务。只有您真的聘请律师，才会产生费用。

6.
哦，明白了。我现在也不确定需不需要律师，希望能免去这步，我实在不想上法庭。
Oh, got it. I'm not sure I need a lawyer—I really hope I can avoid this. I really don't want to go to court.

7.
It's a wise idea to avoid going to court if possible. Why don't you tell me about the details of your problem, and let's start from there?
避免上法庭确实是个明智的想法。您不如先跟我说说您的具体问题，我们从那儿开始？

8.
我和邻居在围栏问题上有分歧。他坚持让我出新围栏一半的费用，但我不同意。
I have a dispute with my neighbour over our fence. He insists I pay half the cost of a new fence, but I refuse.

9.
Could you explain why? It seems you have solid grounds for not wanting to split that cost.
能说说原因吗？听起来您有充足的理由不想分摊这笔费用。

10.
邻居家孩子整整几个小时对着围栏踢球，把围栏踢到严重损坏。我让他们停下，可他们根本不理。
Their kids have been kicking a ball against the fence for hours, leaving it badly damaged. I told them to stop, but they ignored me.

11.
There's a standard process for these disputes. If they damaged the shared fence, they're on the hook for the full cost of the new fence.
通常解决这类纠纷有固定流程：如果是他们造成的共有围栏损坏，就得由他们承担新栅栏的全部费用。

12.
噢！我没意识到这一点！这听起来很有希望啊。不过如果他们不配合，该怎么办呢？
Oh—I didn't realize that! That sounds promising. But what if they refuse to cooperate?

13.
The simplest route is to have a friendly chat with your neighbour and try to reach an agreement.
最简单的做法是先跟邻居好好沟通，看看能不能尽量达成一致。

14.
好，我会这样办的。希望能顺利解决，有需要我会再来电的。谢谢你！
All right—I'll do that. Hopefully it goes smoothly; if not, I'll call back. Thank you!
