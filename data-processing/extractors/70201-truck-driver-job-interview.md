谢谢。我很想在这里工作。贵公司有很好的声誉。
Thanks. I really want to work here. Your company has a very good reputation.

That's good to hear. We are a top company in the industry. Making sure our clients and employees are happy is very important to us.
听到这个我很高兴。我们是行业顶尖的公司。确保我们的客户和员工都满意对我们非常重要。

4.
如果我能得到这份工作就太好了。我想我一定会在这里工作得很开心。但是我知道你们对这份工作有一些法律要求。
It would be wonderful if I could get this job. I think I would be very happy working here. But I know you have some legal requirements for this position.

5.
Yes. We currently have license requirements. We need you to have the correct license before offering you this job.
是的。目前我们对驾照有要求。在聘用您之前，我们需要您持有合适的驾照。

6.
我明白了。我知道你们要检查驾照和驾驶记录。我开车很多年了，记录很好，从来没有任何罚单和事故。
I understand. I know you'll check my license and driving record. I've been driving for many years, with a clean record and no tickets or accidents.

7.
Excellent. That's good. We prefer our drivers to have some driving experience, and we only hire drivers with clean records.
太好了。这很好。我们偏好有驾驶经验的司机，而且只雇用记录良好的司机。

8.
我不清楚你们想让我开什么类型的车。我有普通汽车的驾照，也有卡车驾照。
I'm not clear on what type of vehicle you want me to drive. I have a regular car license, and I also have a truck license.

9.
We need a driver who can drive a truck. We just signed a contract with another company, so we urgently need to find the right driver.
我们需要一名能开卡车的司机。我们刚与另一家公司签了合同，所以急需合适的司机。

10.
我猜你们需要我开卡车。我有开卡车的经验。我之前和另一位候选人聊过，他没有卡车驾照。
I guess you need me to drive a truck. I do have truck-driving experience. I spoke with another candidate earlier—he doesn't have a truck license.

11.
That's great. I think you have a great chance for this job. You have this type of experience that we are looking for.
太好了。我觉得您很有机会得到这份工作。您正好有我们需要的那种经验。

12.
如果我需要考新驾照来增加获得这份工作的机会，我愿意去学习，去考驾照的。
If I need to get a new license to improve my chances of getting this job, I'm willing to go for it and take the test.

13.
No, you have the right license now. I'll let you know the result in a few days.
不用的，您现在的驾照就符合要求。我会在几天后告知您结果。

14.
好的，谢谢。我期待很快收到您的回复。
Okay, thanks. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
