#70160. Rental Inquiry at the Council Office - Business

1.
Good morning. Welcome to the Council Office. Please tell me how I can help you today.
早上好，欢迎来到市政厅办公室。请告诉我今天我能如何帮助您。

2.
上午好，我想要了解更多关于租房的信息。我想要住在这个地区，这里看起来是个很好的地方。
Good morning. I would like to learn more about renting a property. I want to live in this area; it seems like a great place.

3.
Yes, it is. People love to live here. There are many shops and restaurants in this area. The parks are beautiful and very close to the beach.
是的，这里确实如此。人们喜欢住在这里。这个地区有很多商店和餐馆，公园也很美丽，非常靠近海滩。

4.
太好了。我没想到这里的海滩这么棒，而且还这么近。我刚来到澳大利亚时间还不长。目前为止，我见到的所有海滩都很棒。
That's great. I didn't expect the beach here to be so wonderful and so close. I've only recently arrived in Australia, and so far, all the beaches I've seen have been great.

5.
Welcome to Australia. I believe it would be challenging to move to a new country, as many things are quite different.
欢迎来到澳大利亚。我相信搬到一个新国家会很有挑战，因为许多事情都很不同。

6.
是的，确实如此。很多事情都非常不同。如果能找到一个好的住所这会非常有帮助。如果可能的话，我想要注册一个房子或者公寓。
Yes, indeed. Many things are very different. It would be very helpful to find a good place to live. If possible, I would like to register for a house or an apartment.

7.
I'm not sure if I understand what you mean by registering for a house or an apartment.
我不太明白您所说的"注册房屋或公寓"是什么意思。

8.
在我原来的地方，市政办公室负责帮助我们注册房屋，把我们加入申请房屋的等待名单中。
In my previous place, the Council Office was responsible for helping us register for housing and adding us to the waiting list for a property.

9.
I see. That's totally different here. In general, the Council can't provide rental properties and can't help people rent properties.
我明白了。这在这里完全不同。通常情况下，市政办公室不能提供租赁房产，也不能帮助人们租房。

10.
哦，原来是这样。我不确定我现在能做些什么。我从来没有租过房子。
Oh, I see. I'm not sure what I can do now; I have never rented a property before.

11.
Real estate agencies manage rental properties. You could start by talking with them to find a suitable property.
房地产中介负责管理租赁房产。你可以从跟他们谈谈开始，寻找合适的房子。

12.
我在来的路上，看到了两家房屋中介。原来他们是负责这种工作的啊。
I saw two real estate agencies on my way here. It turns out that they are responsible for this kind of work.

13.
There are reviews of agents online. You could have a look, too.
网上有对中介的评价，你也可以看看。

14.
谢谢你的帮助。非常感谢你给我介绍了处理这件事的方法。我期待成为这个社区的一员。
Thank you for your help. Thank you very much for explaining how to deal with this matter. I look forward to becoming a part of this community.
