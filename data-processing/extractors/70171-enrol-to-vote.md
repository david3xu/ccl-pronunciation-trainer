#70171. Enrol to Vote - Legal

1.
Good morning, welcome. I believe you're here for some information about voting in Australia.
早上好，欢迎。我想您是来了解澳大利亚的投票信息的吧。

2.
可不是嘛。我知道全国大选没多久了，我想知道我能不能投票。
Exactly. I know the national election is coming up soon, and I'd like to know if I'm eligible to vote.

3.
You can enroll to vote if you're a citizen and over 18 years old.
如果您是公民，并且年满18岁，就可以登记投票。

4.
我当然不止18岁了，我去年6月份成为了澳大利亚公民，我还有护照。
I'm definitely over 18! I became an Australian citizen last June, and I have my passport.

5.
Great. You must also have lived at your current address for more than one month in order to vote.
很好。您还需要在现住址居住超过一个月，才可以投票。

6.
当然，我在这里住了3年了。我还不太明白怎么注册，你能解释一下吗？
Of course, I've lived here for three years. I'm still not clear on how to enroll—could you explain?

7.
Before you can vote, you have to include your name on the roll. You can enroll online using your passport as proof of identity.
在投票之前，您需要把名字加入选民名单。您可以通过护照在网上登记，作为身份证明。

8.
听起来这是最容易的办法。我还想了解其他注册方法，有时候因为我住的地方的网络问题，我没办法上网。
That sounds like the easiest way. I'd like to know about other methods to enrol. Sometimes, the internet where I live has issues, so I can't get online.

9.
You can print the enrollment form from the election website, and then mail or email it to the election office. Or you can visit the election office and enrol in person.
您可以从选举网站打印注册表，然后邮寄或电邮给选举办公室。您也可以亲自到选举办公室注册。

10.
谢谢，现在我有更多选择了。我会尽早注册，我不想错过投票，离大选已经没几个月了。
Thank you, I have more options now. I'll enrol as soon as possible. I don't want to miss voting, and the election is only a few months away.

11.
By law, Australian citizens must vote, or you'll be fined if you don't. You're doing the right thing by enrolling early.
根据法律，澳大利亚公民必须投票，否则会被罚款。您现在注册是个正确的选择。

12.
我之前不知道，投票让我很兴奋。我会去查看网站并且注册，谢谢你的帮助，和你交谈很高兴。
I didn't know that before. I'm excited to vote! I'll check the website and enroll. Thanks for your help; it's been nice talking with you.
