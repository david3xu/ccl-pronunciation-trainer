#70182. Promotion and Transition - Business

1.
Hi, thank you for meeting me in the morning. How are you today?
嗨，感谢你今天早上抽时间见我。你今天怎么样？

2.
我很好，谢谢。我也很高兴见到你。我助理说你找我是想跟我谈谈我新工作的事情？
I'm doing well, thank you. I'm also glad to see you. My assistant mentioned that you wanted to talk about my new job?

3.
Yes. Congrats on your promotion! You deserve it. We have been very pleased with your dedication and skills since you joined our company.
是的，恭喜你升职！你当之无愧。自从你加入我们公司以来，我们对你的敬业精神和能力非常满意。

4.
谢谢，我很感激，也很感谢你的支持。我很高兴下周就要开始新的工作了。
Thank you, I really appreciate your support. I'm excited to start my new job next week.

5.
It will be a big change for you, but I'm confident you'll continue to achieve even more, just like before.
这对你来说是个很大的变化，但我相信你会像以前一样，不断取得更多成就。

6.
我会尽力的，现在要管理的事情太多了，接下来几周我会忙于学习。
I will do my best. There are so many management tasks now that I'll be busy learning for the next few weeks.

7.
Yes, I also need your help with hiring some new team members; we received notices of resignation from two people today.
是的，我还需要你帮忙招聘一些新成员；今天我们收到两个人的辞职通知。

8.
我明白了。这不是个好时机啊，我希望他们不是负责新产品的关键项目。
I understand. This isn't an ideal time—I hope the departing employees weren't involved in the key projects for our new product.

9.
No, but we still need someone to replace them so that the team doesn't work under too much stress. I want you to choose candidates for interviews and help us fill the positions promptly.
不，但我们还是得找人接替他们，这样团队就不会压力太大。我希望你能挑选候选人进行面试，并尽快补充空缺。

10.
没问题，我很乐意帮忙，但是我不确定我有没有时间，因为我还在处理当前的工作。
No problem, I'm happy to help, but I'm not sure if I'll have enough time because I'm still handling my current workload.

11.
I think it would be best for you to hand over your current responsibilities to your replacement early, so that you can focus on your new job.
我觉得你最好提前把现在的工作交接给你的接替者，这样你就能专心于新工作了。

12.
好啊，听上去是个不错的计划。我已经准备好了交接的文件，所以我明天就可以开始。
That sounds like a great plan. I've already prepared the handover documents, so I can start tomorrow.

13.
Perfect! I'm glad that you are prepared; that's very efficient. It will make our work a lot easier in the coming weeks.
完美！我很高兴你已经准备好了，这真高效。这将使我们接下来的工作轻松许多。

14.
我认为到时候会很忙，但是我很期待这种挑战。
I think it will be very busy then, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.
