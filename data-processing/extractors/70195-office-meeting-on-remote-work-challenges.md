#70195. Office Meeting on Remote Work Challenges - Business

1.
Good morning. I really appreciate you taking the time to come to the office to meet me today.
早上好。感谢你今天抽空来办公室和我见面。

2.
早上好啊。没事的。能见到你和团队的其他人，我很开心。
Good morning. It's okay. I'm really glad to see you and the other members of the team.

3.
That's good to know. I'd like to have a quick chat with you about how your work-from-home setup is coming along. How are things going so far?
那挺好的。我想跟你简单聊聊你在家办公的安排情况。目前都还好吗？

4.
目前都挺好的。虽然我很想念你们，但是不用每天跑办公室上班，真的是帮我省了不少的通勤时间啊！
So far, so good. Although I really miss you all, not having to rush over to the office every day has really saved me a lot of commuting time!

5.
Well, we miss having you around as well, but it's great to know you're enjoying working from home. I understand how much it matters to you.
嗯，我们也很想念跟你一起工作。不过，了解到你喜欢居家办公真是太好了。我理解这对你来说很重要。

6.
是呀。不用再花两个小时在通勤上，真的给我带来了很大的变化。我现在感觉精力充沛了不少。
Yes, not having to spend two hours commuting has made a huge difference. I feel much more energetic now.

7.
That's wonderful to hear. But I've been informed by the IT Department that you've encountered some technical problems recently.
真是太好了。不过，信息技术部跟我说你最近遇到了一些技术问题。

8.
是呀，我家里的网络状况不是很好，尤其是在高峰时段，网速很慢，有时甚至会崩溃。
Yes, my internet connection isn't very good, especially during peak hours: it gets really slow and sometimes it even crashes.

9.
I noticed that you get disconnected from online meetings occasionally, though I wasn't aware that it was due to technical glitches.
我注意到线上会议时你偶尔会掉线，但我不知道这是技术故障造成的。

10.
唉。我试过把路由器放到家里的每一个角落，但是都没有用。技术人员建议更换一台新设备，还要升级到更快的套餐。
Ah, I've tried placing the router in every corner of the house, but nothing worked. The technician suggested replacing it with a new device and upgrading to a faster plan.

11.
I see. We'll arrange to get you a new network device and switch you over to a higher-level plan.
我了解了。我们会给你更换一台新的网络设备，并且帮你升级到一个更高级的套餐。

12.
好的。我都开始担心这些问题会影响我的工作效率和工作量了，技术故障真是让人头疼啊！
Okay. I'm starting to worry that these issues will affect my work efficiency and workload; technical glitches are such a headache!

13.
Don't worry. I'll talk with the appropriate team, and once we have the go-ahead, I'll let you know. You're also welcome to reach out to them directly to get it resolved.
别担心。我会跟相关团队沟通，一批下来就通知你。你也可以直接联系他们解决。

14.
太好了。我真的非常感激你帮我解决这个问题。我希望能尽快恢复到正常的工作状态。
That's great. I truly appreciate your help in resolving this issue. I hope to get back to normal work as soon as possible.
