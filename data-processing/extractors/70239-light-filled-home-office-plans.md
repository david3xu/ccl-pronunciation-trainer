#70239. Light-Filled Home Office Plans - Business

1.
Hi, it's great to see you. It feels like ages since our last chat. Have you been away or just super busy? How have you been keeping?
嗨，见到你真高兴。感觉上次聊天过去好久了。你最近是出门了，还是单纯特别忙？最近怎么样啊？

2.
是啊，有一段时间了。最近一直在装修我的房子，现在终于完工了。整个过程很累，但是值得。
Yeah, it's been a while. I've been renovating my house, and it's finally done now. The entire process is tiring but it is totally worth it.

3.
Great! I remember seeing your plans! It was a massive job. Really glad it went smoothly for you. The final result must be so satisfying!
太好了！我记得看过你的设计图，工程特别大。真高兴你一切顺利。最后效果一定很满意吧！

4.
一切都很顺利。幸运的是，我们找到了一个靠谱的建筑商。大工程完成了，装饰是更有趣的部分。
Everything went well. Luckily, we found a reliable builder. The major work is done, and the decorating part is more fun!

5.
True, it must be overwhelming with all those decisions. Picking finishes takes real patience!
是啊，做这么多决定肯定很头疼。选装修材料可得有耐心！

6.
我们一次只装修一个房间，这样就更容易管理。而且不用赶时间，我们可以慢慢琢磨。
We're doing one room at a time to keep it more manageable. No rush. We can take our time to think things through.

7.
That's smart. Taking your time ensures the house turns out just right. Which room are you tackling now?
这法子聪明。慢慢来才能把房子装出理想效果。你们现在弄哪个房间？

8.
我们在装修时，弄了个大阁楼。现在准备把它做成家庭办公室，那里的自然光线特别好。
During the renovation, we added a spacious loft. Now we plan to turn it into a home office. The natural light there is perfect!

9.
Those massive windows must give amazing natural light! Perfect for an office. Have you picked out a desk yet?
大窗户，采光肯定超棒！做办公室绝了。桌子选好了吗？

10.
家具全用素净的颜色，不选深色桌子。另外我还打算装百叶窗。
All furniture is in neutral colours, no dark desks. Plus, I plan to add blinds.

11.
Good call! Making sure you are happy with it for years is important! You don't want to redecorate again too soon.
明智的选择！确保这个装修能让你喜欢很多年是很重要的，谁都不想太快重新装修一遍。

12.
我同意你说的。所以，我们会用简单素净的设计，然后用小地毯这种容易换的小东西来增加一些鲜艳的色彩。
I agree. That's why we'll go for simple and neutral designs and add some bright colors with easy-to-swap items like rugs.

13.
Love that idea! Seriously can't wait to see it finished. You must send me photos! I bet it's going to look fantastic!
这主意好！真是都等不及想看成果了！你一定得发照片给我！我觉得肯定会超级好看！

14.
我也等不及请你来参观了！不过，还得等一阵子，收尾工作比预想耗时。我也不想太赶了。
Can't wait to show you either! Still need some time though – the finishing touches are taking longer than expected. I don't want to rush it either.
