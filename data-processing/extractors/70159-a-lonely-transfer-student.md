#70159. A Lonely Transfer Student - Education

1.
Hi, thank you for coming to see me. I understand you want to talk about your daughter at her new school, right?
你好，谢谢你来见我。我知道你想谈谈你女儿在新学校的情况，对吗？

2.
很高兴您给我打电话。我一直想约您见面谈这件事。
I'm glad you called me. I've been wanting to meet with you to discuss this.

3.
I know you changed a school for your daughter. That's good for her. But it sounds like she has some new problems.
我知道你给你女儿换了学校，这对她来说是件好事。不过听起来她似乎遇到了一些新问题。

4.
是的，转学之后她的成绩提高了不少。但是在社交方面有些困难。她没交到什么朋友。
Yes, her grades have improved a lot since the transfer. But she's having some trouble socially. She hasn't made any friends.

5.
It's good that her marks improved. That's a positive sign. She may just need more time to settle in and make friends.
她的成绩有提高，这是个好兆头。她可能只是需要更多时间来适应和交朋友。

6.
可能吧。我有点担心她。她不怎么说话，但是我觉得她很孤独。我不想她的成绩再下降。
Maybe. I'm a bit worried about her. She doesn't talk much, but I think she's feeling lonely. I don't want her grades to drop again.

7.
Maybe some after-school activities will help. Is she interested in anything?
也许一些课外活动会有所帮助。她对什么感兴趣吗？

8.
她以前参加团体运动，但是后来，她之前的学校发生了霸凌事件，她就放弃了。她还挺擅长运动的。
She used to participate in team sports, but she quit after a bullying incident at her old school. She's quite good at sports.

9.
Team sports can be a good opportunity to get to know more classmates. Does the school have any teams?
团体运动是认识更多同学的好机会。学校有什么校队吗？

10.
有。我想应该有篮球队和足球队。她在以前的学校经常踢足球。
Yes. I think they have a basketball and a football team. She used to play football a lot at her previous school.

11.
That's great! She should be able to join without any problems if she played football before.
太好了！如果她以前踢过足球，加入应该没问题的。

12.
她马上放学回家了。我会和她聊一聊，让她去试一下。
She's coming home from school soon. I'll talk to her and encourage her to give it a try.

13.
Encourage her to try. It's something extra for her to do. I think it may help.
鼓励她试一试吧。这给她增加了一些额外的事情去做。我觉得这可能会有帮助。

14.
同意。之前我不知道能为她做些什么。但是和您交流感觉很有帮助。谢谢您。
I agree. I didn't know what I could do for her before but talking with you has been very helpful. Thank you.
