#70190. From Crib to Platform Bed - Social+Business

1.
Hey! It's so nice to see you again. It feels like forever since we last caught up. How have you been?
嗨！再见到你真好。感觉我们很久没聊天了，你最近怎么样？

2.
是啊，好一阵子没见了。这段时间我一直忙着装修家里，现在终于搞定了。总算可以好好享受新家的感觉了！
Yeah, it's been a while! I've been caught up with renovating my home and now it's finally done. I can finally enjoy my new home!

3.
That's awesome! I remember when you showed me your renovation plans. It felt like a huge project. Did everything go as planned?
太棒了！我记得你之前给我看过装修计划，感觉是个大工程。一切顺利吗？

4.
是的，整体来说都挺顺利的。幸运的是，我们找到了一家很靠谱的建筑公司，大工程已经完成了。现在我们正忙着做最后的装饰，让家更有个性。
Yeah, overall, everything went pretty smoothly. Luckily, we found a great contractor, and the big work is done. Now we're just focusing on decorating and adding some personal touches.

5.
Totally! Decorating the entire house must be exhausting, especially with so many decisions to make. It can be overwhelming!
完全同意！给整个房子做装饰肯定是件大工程，特别是要选那么多东西，会很有压力。

6.
我们每次只装饰一个房间，这样不会太赶。反正也不赶时间，这样还能慢慢挑喜欢的东西，不会买了又后悔。
We're taking it one room at a time, so it doesn't feel too overwhelming. There's no rush anyway, and this way, we can carefully pick things we really love instead of making impulsive choices.

7.
That's a great approach! Taking your time means you can really make sure everything turns out just the way you want. What room are you working on at the moment?
这种方式很棒！慢慢来才能装出自己真正喜欢的感觉。你现在在弄哪个房间？

8.
我现在在装饰我女儿的房间。她马上要从婴儿床换成大的平台床了。她成长得实在是太快了！感觉昨天她还在学走路呢！
I'm decorating my daughter's room right now. She's about to move from her crib to a bigger platform bed—it's crazy how fast she's growing! Feels like just yesterday she was learning to walk!

9.
Switching to a platform bed is an important milestone! There are so many great bed options, and some even come with built-in storage.
换平台床可是个重要的里程碑呀。现在很多床都不错，有些还带储物功能。

10.
对啊，这太方便了！儿童房的储物真的很重要，所以我想买一个能用很多年的床，最好是她能一直睡到青少年时期的。
Yeah, that would be so convenient! Storage is a huge deal in a kid's room, so I want to get her a bed that'll last for years, hopefully even into her teenage years.

11.
That's a smart choice. You don't want to redecorate too soon, so getting something that lasts makes a lot of sense.
这个想法很明智，没人想这么快又重新装修，买个耐用的确实更划算。

12.
我们也这么想。所以，我们喜欢简单素净的设计，然后用小地毯这种容易换的小东西来增加一些鲜艳的色彩。
We feel the same way. That's why we go for simple and neutral designs and add some bright colors with easy-to-swap items like rugs.

13.
That sounds perfect! I can't wait to see how your place turns out when everything's done. I bet it's going to look fantastic!
听起来很棒！我特别期待看看你家装好的样子。我觉得肯定会超级好看！

14.
我也很期待让你过来看看！不过估计还得花点时间。慢慢装饰才能让家更有感觉，我不想匆匆忙忙地搞定它。
I'm looking forward to having you over too! But it'll probably take a little more time. Taking it slow makes a home feel more inviting—I don't want to rush it.
