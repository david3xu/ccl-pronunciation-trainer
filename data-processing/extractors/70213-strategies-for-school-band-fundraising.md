#70213. Strategies for School Band Fundraising - Business

1.
Hey, come on in and grab a chair! My bad for being swamped yesterday! Now I've got all the time to chat about this.
嗨，快进来坐吧。昨天我太忙了实在不好意思，现在我时间很充裕，咱们慢慢聊。

2.
我之前是想跟你讨论，怎么给我们的学校乐队筹集资金，让孩子们有更多资金参加音乐巡演。你有什么想法吗？
I wanted to talk with you about how to raise some money for our school band, so the kids can have more funds to go on music tours. Do you have any ideas?

3.
Well, I feel like we could totally put together a fundraiser. We just need to pick the right kind of event, like the kind of event people would jump at attending.
嗯，我感觉咱们完全可以搞个筹款活动。我们只需要选对活动类型，需要大家迫不及待抢着来参加的那种活动。

4.
要不，我们弄一本附近商家的优惠券手册，卖给家长和社区居民？或者搞些附近商家的东西卖钱，怎么样？
How about this: we put together a coupon book with deals from the local businesses, and sell it to parents and people in the community? Or maybe we could sell some products from the local shops to raise money?

5.
These are all great ideas. But hey, how about putting on a concert for the school band? We could use the school's venue and equipment, which would help keep the costs down.
这些都很棒。不过哎，你觉得给学校乐队办场音乐会怎么样？我们可以用学校的场地和设施，这样可以节约开支。

6.
这主意靠谱！可以展现孩子们的才艺！家长们肯定乐意出钱支持的。我们多宣传，绝对人气爆棚！
That's a solid idea! It'd be a great way to show off the kids' talents. I'm sure the parents would be more than happy to chip in and support. If we really get the word out, people will definitely come!

7.
I think it's a solid idea too! Hosting the event at school would save us a lot on venue costs. We could also invite a few local bands to come and perform.
我也觉得很好！在学校办活动，能省下大笔的场地费。我们还可以再请些本地乐队来表演助阵。

8.
我喜欢这个点子！还能让音乐会更专业，更热闹！乐队成员的亲友团绝对会来撑场子的！
I love that idea! It would make the concert more professional and way more exciting. The band members' friends and families are definitely gonna show up to support!

9.
Yeah, seeing these local bands could really motivate the kids to rehearse harder. Plus, the local bands might promote the concert on their social media too!
是的，孩子们看到这些本地乐队，会更有动力排练。本地乐队也可能会在社交媒体宣传这次音乐会！

10.
太棒了，那就等于免费宣传了！我们可以再发动家长们制作蛋糕，甜点和饮料来义卖。
Awesome, that basically means free promotion! We could also get the parents to make some cakes, desserts, and drinks to sell for fundraising.

11.
Genius! That way, the vibe will be way more enjoyable! It would make the whole thing more fun for everyone!
妙啊！这样现场气氛更愉快，每个人都能待得更开心！

12.
可以！细节方面，咱们得再敲定一下，还要联系附近商家，拉拉赞助。
Sounds good! We'll just need to finalize the details and reach out to some local businesses for sponsorship.

13.
Absolutely! Shall we chat again the day after tomorrow? We'll also need to apply early for permission to use the school venue.
必须的！后天我们再碰一次怎么样？我们也需要早点跟学校申请场地使用的许可。

14.
好的，咱们到时候可以谈谈怎么分头联系家长和商家。我这几天先列个待办清单。
Alright. We can then figure out how to divide things up—like who'll talk to the parents and who'll reach out to the local businesses. I'll put together a to-do list over the next few days.
