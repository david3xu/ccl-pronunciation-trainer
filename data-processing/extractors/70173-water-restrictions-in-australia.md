#70173. Water Restrictions in Australia - Social+Legal

1.
Good morning, thank you for your call. How can I help you today?
早上好，感谢您的来电。我能帮您什么忙吗？

2.
我刚搬到这里，我有些关于用水限制的问题。
I just moved here, and I have some questions about water restrictions.

3.
I'd be happy to help. Right now, we're at Level Two water restrictions.
我很乐意帮忙。目前我们处于二级水限制。

4.
我刚来到澳大利亚，不熟悉用水限制。我邻居说这跟降雨量不足有关。
I just came to Australia, and I'm not familiar with the water restrictions. My neighbor said it has something to do with low rainfall.

5.
Yes, that's right. Because of low rainfall, we need to conserve water. That means there are certain rules about how and when you can use it at home.
没错，因为降雨量不足，我们需要节约用水。这意味着家里用水会有一些规则，关于怎么用水和什么时候用水。

6.
我明白了。那很有道理。在我的国家，我们有季风，干旱，洪水。这些甚至比降水量少更严重，我知道在澳大利亚的情况不一样。
I see. That makes a lot of sense. In my country, we have monsoons, droughts, and floods. Those are even worse than low rainfall. I know the situation is different in Australia.

7.
Exactly. When we don't get enough rain, the water levels in the reservoirs behind dams drop, which affects our drinking water supply. This is a problem.
没错。如果降雨不足，大坝后的水库水位就会下降，这会影响我们的饮用水供应。这是个问题。

8.
但是，在天气很热很干的时候，我的草坪和花园都会被影响到。我可以给它们浇水吗？
But when it's really hot and dry, my lawn and garden get affected. Am I allowed to water them?

9.
Yes, you can, but only with a watering can. And you should do it before 10AM or after 4 PM—just not in the middle of the day.
是的，您可以，但只能用浇水壶。而且您应该在早上10点之前或下午4点之后浇水，不要在中午时分。

10.
好的，我会照你说的做的。我会去园艺中心买个喷壶。我想我们只能希望早点下雨。
Got it! I'll follow the rules. I'll go to a gardening center to buy a watering can. I guess we can only hope for some rain soon.

11.
If you need more information about water restrictions, you can check the council's website. There's a page with all the details.
如果您需要更多关于用水限制的信息，可以查阅市政网站。网站上有一页详细介绍所有内容。

12.
听起来很不错。我会去网站上看看的。我不想因为不熟悉规定而做错事情。
That sounds great. I'll check out the website. I don't want to make any mistakes because I'm not familiar with the rules.

13.
Restrictions will change as well. You can sign up for notifications on the website, so you'll always be updated. This would help you.
限制也会发生变化。您可以在网站上注册接收通知，这样您就能随时获得更新。这会帮助您。
