Hello, Dr. Chen. Welcome! Take a seat please. How can I help you today?
您好，陈博士。欢迎欢迎！请坐吧。我今天能帮您什么呢？

2.
你好，我今天来是想要了解一下当前的移民趋势，因为我最近正要写一篇与澳大利亚移民有关的报告。
Hello. I'm here today to learn about the current immigration trend because I'm about to write a report about Australian immigration.

3.
I'm more than happy to help you. As an immigration country, about 1 quarter of Australians were born overseas. Currently the two main types of immigrants in Australia mainly come with a family reunion visa or a skilled independent visa.
我非常乐意帮助您。作为一个移民国家，大约有1/4的澳大利亚人是在海外出生的。目前在澳大利亚的两种主要移民类型主要是家庭团聚移民签证或者独立技术移民签证。

4.
谢谢您。这个状况我也了解过。资料显示，在2012年的时候，来自中国的技术移民有12,000人，家庭团聚移民有6,000人。
Thank you. I've looked into that/come across that as well. According to the data, in 2012, there were 12,000 skilled migrants from China and 6,000 (who came) on a family reunion visa/on family reunion visas.

5.
That's true. To successfully apply for a family reunion visa, applicants must be sponsored by their family members. For skilled migrants, they must have professional skills or business experience.
您说的对。想成功申请家庭团聚签证，申请人必须有家人担保他们。对于独立技术移民，他们需要有专业技能或者商业经验。

6.
我明白了。最近我看的新闻好多都与难民有关。好多媒体还说未来会有更多难民涌入澳洲。那难民移民目前在澳洲是什么样的状况呢?
I see. A lot of news that I've read recently is related to refugees. According to a lot of media, more refugees will pour into Australia in the future. What're refugee immigrants like in Australia now?

7.
Yes, it's a hotly debated topic. The community has been concerned more about refugees, but they only contribute to 10% of immigration. Most immigrants mainly obtain their permanent residency with other categories of visa.
是的，这个话题可以说是备受热议了。社区更加担心难民的问题了，不过难民只占了移民的10%。大多数移民还是通过其他种类的签证拿到他们的永久居住权的。

8.
哦，真的吗？您能具体说说吗？
Oh, really? Could you be more specific?

9.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, around 58% of migrants had been granted a skilled visa, 32 percent entered via the family stream and just 10 percent were on humanitarian visas.
根据澳大利亚统计局的信息，大约58%的移民拿的是技术移民签证，32%的移民是通过家庭类移民来澳的，只有10%的移民拿的是人道主义签证。

10.
我明白了。我还听说，移民的总数正在减少，尤其是来自中国的移民，是吗？
I see. I also heard that the number of immigrants has been decreasing, especially for migrants from China. Is that true?

11.
That's true, the total number of immigrants has been decreasing in the recent years and migrants from China have decreased by 12% compared to last year. However, China is still the second largest emigration country, behind New Zealand, in Australia.
是的。近年来移民总数一直在减少。跟去年相比，来自中国的移民减少了12%。然而，中国依然是向澳大利亚移民第二多的国家，仅次于新西兰。
