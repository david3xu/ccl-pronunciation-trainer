#70167. Discussing an engagement Party - Social+Business

1.
Hi. How are you? I just received an invitation to your daughter's engagement party.
你好，最近怎么样？我刚收到你女儿订婚派对的请帖。

2.
哦, 那太好了! 我还在想着，你什么时候才能收到请帖呢。
Oh, that's great! I was just wondering when you'd get the invitation.

3.
Yes. Mail service is slow these days, but it is nicer to receive a proper invitation rather than an email.
是啊，最近邮递服务慢了点，但比起邮件，收到正式的请帖还是更好。

4.
我希望，大家都能来她的订婚仪式。我们的请帖发得比较早，因为，我们需要一些时间去准备。我真的希望，你能来参加。
I really hope everyone can come to her engagement party. We sent the invitations out early because we need some time to prepare. I really hope you can make it.

5.
I understand. It's an important occasion and there's a lot to plan. I should be able to come, and I will put the date into my diary.
我明白，这是个重要的场合，有很多要安排的。我应该能去，我会把日期记在日历上。

6.
那我就太高兴了！我希望能找到一个好地方，把大家都聚在一起。我和我女儿还没确定在哪里举行仪式呢！
That would make me so happy! I hope we can find a good place to bring everyone together. My daughter and I haven't decided on the venue yet.

7.
Oh dear. It can be hard to find a good place. If she wants to have a formal one, I know somewhere good. It's a new restaurant that overlooks a lovely beach.
哎呀，找个好地方确实不容易。如果她想办个正式的，我知道一个不错的地方。是一家新开的餐厅，能看到美丽的海滩景色。

8.
她确实想要一个正式的仪式。她希望每个人都盛装出席，或者，至少穿得正式一点。她想办一个酒会，而不是坐下吃饭的晚宴。
She does want a formal ceremony. She hopes everyone will dress up, or at least wear something a bit formal. She's thinking of having a cocktail party, not a sit-down banquet.

9.
That restaurant is perfect for her then. There is a beautiful beach view with a deck outside and fancy décor inside.
那家餐厅就很适合她呀，外面有个露台可以看到海滩，里面的装饰也很高级。

10.
听起来很好呀。她现在还在考虑呢，因为有太多选择了，真不好决定呀。
Sounds great! She's still thinking about it—there are so many options, it's hard to make a decision.

11.
I'm happy to help you plan if you need. I am retired now, and I used to work as an event planner for a few years.
如果你需要，我很愿意帮忙。我现在退休了，以前做了好几年活动策划。

12.
我还真不知道你以前做过活动策划呀！我们确实需要帮忙。我和我女儿已经忙不过来了，都压得喘不过来气了。你能抽时间帮我们，真的是太慷慨了！我太感激了！
I didn't know you used to work as an event planner! We really need help. My daughter and I are swamped, we're barely keeping up. It's so generous of you to offer your time. I'm really grateful.

13.
I'm happy to help if you would like. I can meet you and your daughter in a few days to talk more.
如果你愿意的话, 我很乐意帮忙的。我们可以过几天再见面，跟你和你女儿详细聊聊。

14.
太好了！有你的帮忙真是太好了！很开心能在这里遇见你！
Great! It's wonderful to have your help. I'm so happy to have run into you here!
