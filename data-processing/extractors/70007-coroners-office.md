#70007. Coroner's Office - Legal

1.
Good morning, Mr. Li. I know that you've come to see me today regarding your mother's death. I have some questions for you.
早上好，李先生。我知道你今天来是有关你母亲的死亡。我有些问题要问你。

2.
你好。我正好想问你呢。你们把我母亲的遗体放在哪儿了？我什么时候可以取回我母亲的遗体呢？
Hello. I was about to ask you. Where do you keep my mother's body? When can I get it back?

3.
Your mother's body is currently in the morgue of a local hospital. We still need time to exam your mother's body. How did you find out about her death?
你母亲的遗体目前在一家当地医院的停尸房里。我们还需要时间来检验它。你是怎么发现你母亲的死亡的？

4.
那天早上我起来以后，发现她躺在客厅的地上。我叫她，她没有回应。于是我打电话叫了救护车。
That morning, after I got up, I found her lying on the floor of the living room. I called her, but there was no response. So, I called an ambulance.

5.
Unfortunately, your mother has passed away before the ambulance arrived, so they have to contact the police for further investigation. Because your mother does not have any medical records in Australia, we have to perform an autopsy on her body to determine the cause of death. How did your mother come to Australia?
遗憾的是，在救护车来之前，你母亲就已经去世了，所以他们只能联系警方来做进一步调查。因为你母亲在澳大利亚没有任何就医记录，我们必须要做尸检来查明死因。你母亲是怎么来澳大利亚的呢？

6.
我母亲是持旅游签证来到澳大利亚的。虽然她年纪很大，但是精神一直很好，平时也几乎不生病，所以她没有在澳大利亚看过医生。
My mother came to Australia on a tourist visa. Although she was quite old, she was always full of energy and she barely got sick. That's why she didn't see any doctors in Australia.

7.
We need to investigate this further. The coroner will order a post mortem to decide if there is any medical cause behind your mother's death.
我们需要进一步调查此事。死因裁判官会安排尸检，来看看她的死亡背后是否有任何医学上的原因。

8.
我很尊重澳大利亚的法律，但是作为中国人，是很忌讳这个的，能不能保持她的全尸呢？我想在最后一刻尽一份孝心。
I respect the law of Australia, however, as Chinese, we see it as a big taboo. Could you keep her body intact? I want to fulfill my filial piety at the last moment.

9.
As her next of kin, if you intend to object to the post mortem, you can submit an objection in writing with your concerns to the coroner's office, stating your reasons.
作为她的最近亲，如果你想反对验尸，你可以递交一封书面反对书，写明你的担忧，并且陈述你的反对原因，交给死因裁判官办公室。

10.
那我究竟什么时候可以取回我母亲的遗体呢？希望你们好好处理她的遗体，我母亲生前信佛，对下葬的时辰有讲究。我想尽快安排她的葬礼。
So when exactly can I get my mother's body back? I hope you can take care of her body properly. She was a Buddhist, and she was particular about the timing of burying her. I want to arrange her funeral as soon as possible.

11.
Your rejection may delay the release of the corpse. We will assist you in the process of returning the body. Should there be any updates, we will notify you at the earliest convenience.
你的反对可能会推迟尸体发还的时间。我们会在返还尸体的过程中协助你的。如果有任何进展，我们会在方便的第一时间通知你的。

12.
好的，谢谢你，那我就等你的通知了。
Okay, thank you. Then I'll just wait for you notice.
