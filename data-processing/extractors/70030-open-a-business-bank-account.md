#70030. Open a Business Bank Account - Business

1.
Good morning. I'm a banker of this branch and my name is Joanne. How may I help you today?
早上好，我是这家分行的客户经理，我叫乔安。我今天能怎么帮到您呢？

2.
你好。今天我刚注册了一家出口公司。听说你们银行为客户提供很好的商业建议。
Hi. I've just registered an export company today. I heard your bank offers great business advice for your clients.

3.
Yes, we do. Do you have a few minutes? We could go through some basic questions. Are you running a small sized business?
是的。可以占用您几分钟吗？我们可以过一下一些基本的问题。您现在经营的是一家小型企业吗？

4.
虽然现在是小公司，但要是按照预期发展的话，我以后就是一家大出口公司的主管了。
Although it's currently a small-sized company, I'll be the manager of a big export company in the future if things work out as I have planned.

5.
I hope so. Then I assume you only need a company bank account for this stage?
我希望也是这样。那我想，您目前这个阶段只需要一个公司银行账户对吗？

6.
我也这么觉得。我需要信用卡账户和支票本。作为出口公司，我们大部分交易是通过支票本进行的。
I believe so. I need a credit card account and a checkbook. As an export company, most of our transactions go through checkbook.

7.
Our Export Business Start Package is probably what you need, but it doesn't include a checkbook. Most people transfer money through wire transfer.
我们的出口公司启动套餐应该就是您需要的，但是里面不包括支票本。大部分人是通过电汇转账的。

8.
我不相信电汇。过去吃了一次大亏，因为电汇亏了一大笔钱。
I don't really believe wire transfer. I suffered a big loss in the past, losing a lot of money because of it.

9.
I'm sorry to hear that. We hear about this from time to time. In our bank, we use a secure portal to do oversea transfers.
很抱歉听到这个。我们时不时听说这种事情发生。我们银行是是用安全入口来完成国际转账的。

10.
我能拿到你们的信用卡吗？我已经在澳大利亚住了7年了。
Am I eligible for your credit card? I have lived in Australia for seven years.

11.
Before that process, we'll need to confirm some information. I could apply for a credit card for you if you have the company's certificate of registration and 100 points of identification with you today.
在那之前，我们需要确认一些信息。如果您今天带了公司注册证明和个人100分的身份证明文件，我就能帮您申请了。

12.
我要先想一下。我还不知道你们会给我什么商业建议。没有支票本对我来说是个大问题。
I need to think about it first. I still don't know what business advice you'll give me. Not having a checkbook would be a big problem for me.
