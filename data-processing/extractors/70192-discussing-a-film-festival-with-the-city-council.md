#70192. Discussing a Film Festival with the City Council - Social

1.
Hey there, welcome to the council hall! What brings you here today?
你好，欢迎来到市政厅！今天有什么能帮您的？

2.
下午好！我来是想问问我正在策划的一个社区活动。
Good afternoon, I'd like to ask about the community event I'm organizing.

3.
Of course! Can you give me more details about the event? How do you think the city council can help?
没问题！可以多给我讲讲这个活动吗？你觉得市政厅能怎么帮你？

4.
是这样的，我发现最近有一些新移民搬到这里，我想通过组织一个活动，向他们介绍澳大利亚的文化。
Well, I've noticed that some new migrants have moved in recently, so I'd like to organize an event to showcase Australian culture.

5.
Wow! We're always happy to welcome new migrants from different parts of the world who have settled in this area. I think this is a fantastic idea.
哇！我们一直很欢迎来自世界各地的新移民搬到这个社区定居。我觉得这个想法真的太棒了。

6.
谢谢你！我想咨询一下，能不能租下社区大厅一周？我打算办一个小型的澳大利亚电影节。
Thank you! I'd like to know if I can hire the community hall for a week. I'm planning to hold a small Australian film festival.

7.
You can rent the community hall for an entire week, but it will depend on the schedule and whether the space is available.
您可以租用社区大厅一整周，但这取决于时间安排和场地是否空闲。

8.
我了解了。我计划六个月以后举办电影节。为了拿到批准，我可真是费了不少工夫啊。
I got it. I'm planning to hold the film festival in six months. Getting the approval for it really took me quite a lot of effort.

9.
I'm sure putting this event together takes a lot of effort, but it sounds fantastic. I believe many people will love it.
筹备这个活动肯定需要不少工夫。但听起来真的很棒。我相信会有很多人喜欢的。

10.
只要场地确定下来，我就可以开始在本地做宣传了。我希望能吸引更多人来参加。
Once the venue is confirmed, I can start promoting it locally. I hope to attract more people to join.

11.
The council might be able to assist with promotion. Our local engagement team can help with that. This is a wonderful event.
可能市政厅可以帮你宣传。我们的本地推广团队可以帮忙。这个活动很棒。

12.
太感谢了！我真的希望活动能办得成功。市政厅的宣传支持对我来说帮助很大，能吸引更多人来参与。
Thank you so much! I really hope the event will be a success. The council's support in promotion is a big help to me, and it will attract more people to participate.

13.
How about coming over to meet the events team? They'll be available tomorrow, so you can finalize the venue and go over the advertising details.
要不要过来见见活动团队？他们明天有空，你可以确认场地，并商量宣传的细节。

14.
太棒了！我明天整天都有空，那就明天见咯！谢谢你的帮助，期待和团队见面！
That's great! I'm free all day tomorrow, so I'll see you then! Thanks for your help, and I'm looking forward to meeting the team!
