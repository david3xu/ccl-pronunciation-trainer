#70180. Downsizing After 15 Years - Business

1.
Good afternoon, thank you for calling. Please let me know what help you need today.
下午好，感谢您的来电。请告诉我今天需要什么帮助。

2.
下午好，我看到你们卖房子的广告，我想要了解这个。
Good afternoon, I saw your advertisement about selling houses and would like to know more about it.

3.
Of course. Buying and selling properties is my main business, although we do manage rental apartments in town.
当然。买卖房产是我的主要业务，虽然我们也管理市区的出租公寓。

4.
我有一个七个卧室的房子，离市区不远，我已经在那里住了15年了，我想把它卖掉。
I have a seven-bedroom house not far from the city center. I have lived there for 15 years and now want to sell it.

5.
It must be a big change after 15 years. Fortunately, it's a very good time to sell at the moment, so you picked an opportune time.
过了15年，一定变化很大。好在现在卖房是个不错的时机，所以您选择的时机非常合适。

6.
我的孩子们都搬出去了，所以我想要换一个小房子。但是我不太清楚卖房子的方式都有哪些。
My children have all moved out, so I want to downsize. However, I'm not very clear about the various methods of selling a house.

7.
It's okay. It's something that all homeowners need to consider before they sell their properties. There are several different options you can consider.
没关系。卖房前每个房主都需要考虑这个问题。有几种不同的方式，您都可以考虑。

8.
那时我是从我朋友那里买的房子，我对于不同的卖房方式以及各自的优点都不了解。
I bought the house from a friend, so I'm not familiar with the different selling methods and their advantages.

9.
The size of the house is typical for this area. Private treaty sales can be effective for achieving a realistic price.
在这个区域，这种房子的面积是常见的。采用私人协议方式销售可以更容易达到一个合理的价格。

10.
我觉得有一个特定的价格是好的。这样的话，我就大概能知道期待的价格是多少了。
I think having a fixed price is good. That way, I can have an idea of what to expect.

11.
Yes. It helps the buyer as well—you have more time to consider all the offers. Unlike auctions, you don't need to set a specific date to sell the property.
是的，这样也有助于买家，让您有更多时间考虑所有的报价。与拍卖不同，您不需要为出售房产设定一个特定的日期。

12.
听你这样说很好。就像其他卖家一样，我想尽量卖个好价钱。你觉得卖这个房子推荐哪种方式呢？
That sounds good. Like other sellers, I want to get the best price possible. Which selling method do you recommend for this house?

13.
I need to visit your house first. If you are at home Wednesday afternoon, I can come then. You just need to text me your address.
我需要先去您家看看。若您周三下午在家，我可以那时过来。您发短信告诉我地址就好。

14.
好的，谢谢。这对我来说很合适。期待周三下午见您。祝您有个愉快的一天。
Alright, thank you. That works well for me. I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday afternoon. Have a great day!
