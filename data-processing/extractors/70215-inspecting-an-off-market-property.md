#70215. Inspecting An Off-Market Property - Business

1.
Hi there! Long time no see! I had no clue you are house hunting!
嘿！好久不见！我不知道你在看房呢。

2.
是呀。我们租房子住好多年了，我觉得，是时候买下一套属于自己的房子啦。
Exactly, we've been renting for years and I feel it's time to have a place of my own.

3.
I totally get it. This area's super convenient, with the mall and the park nearby. If you moved elsewhere, you'd have to re-learn everything all over again.
我完全明白。这地段多方便啊，商场公园都在旁边。要是搬到别的地方，你就得重新熟悉一遍周边环境。

4.
可不是嘛，能不动地方最好了。我们不想让孩子们又要换学校，又要重新适应一遍周围的一切。
Absolutely, staying put would be ideal. We don't want the kids to have to switch schools and adjust to everything all over again.

5.
Exactly. The market is flooded with listings now, but it might take a bit to find the right one. Any luck so far?
确实，市面上现在房源很多，但找到合适的可能需要点时间。目前你有看中的吗？

6.
我们看了不少房子了，有一套房子我们特别中意，但是，价格超标了。我们不想让手头太紧。
We've seen quite a few properties. There's one we really like, but it's over our budget. We don't want to stretch our finances.

7.
That's a shame. But it's smart to stick to your budget. Don't worry, it doesn't mean you won't find something you love. There's plenty of fish in the sea.
真可惜，不过，量入为出是对的。别急，这不代表你们找不到喜欢的房子。好房子多的是。

8.
我们希望能买一套空房子，这样一切都简单。我不喜欢到处堆满家具和杂物的房子。我觉得我们没办法搬进那样的房子。
We'd like an empty property — that keeps things simple. I don't like houses cluttered with furniture and stuff; I don't think we could move into one like that.

9.
You may want to focus on the floor plan, rather than getting distracted by the furnishings. Decorations can always be changed later.
或许，你们可以关注房子的户型图，而不是被家具干扰。房子的装饰到后面都能改的。

10.
有些户型我们就是接受不了。我们不想要复式，只想要平层。
Some layouts just won't work for us; we don't want a two-story home—we prefer a single-level place.

11.
It might be worth checking out some of the older homes in the area. They often match what you're looking for. I can help you find them.
或许可以看看这个区一些年代久一些的房子——它们往往更符合你们的需求。我可以帮你找找。

12.
谢谢你。我们不想大改结构。最多，微调一两个房间的布局，就可以啦。
Thank you. We don't want major renovations. At most, we'd just tweak the layout of one or two rooms.

13.
Actually, there's one property that could be perfect, but it's not officially listed. I know the owner personally, and can set up an inspection.
其实，有一处房产可能很合适，但房子还没挂牌呢。我认识屋主，可以帮你们安排看房。

14.
太好了。帮我们安排一下吧。希望这次能成。真希望这套房子能满足我们全家的需求啊。
Fantastic! Please help arrange it for us. Fingers crossed this works out! I really hope this house will meet our family's needs.
