#70177. Booking a 100th Birthday Shoot - Business

1.
Good morning! Thanks for calling Photography Moments. This is Penny speaking
早上好！感谢致电"摄影时刻"，我是佩妮。

2.
你好，佩妮，我想预约拍一些照片。有人向我推荐了你，说你是很棒的家庭摄影师。
Hi Penny, I'd like to book a photoshoot. Someone recommended you to me and said you're an amazing family photographer.

3.
That's lovely to hear! Many of my clients come back to capture different moments in their lives.
真高兴听到这个！我的很多客户都会回来，记录他们人生中的不同时刻。

4.
我觉得和一个摄影师长期合作是很好的。我认为和别人一起工作一段时间也是很好的。照片很重要，没有照片的话，很难记住很多人生重要时刻。
I think it's great to work with a photographer long-term. I believe working with someone over time is really beneficial. Photos are so important—without them, it's hard to remember many of life's important moments.

5.
That's so true! I enjoy giving reminders of capturing special occasions and meaningful moments. It's also fun to meet different people.
太对了！我喜欢帮大家记录捕捉那些特别的日子和有意义的时刻。而且，认识新的人也很有趣。

6.
我的好祖母快100岁了，我想给她拍一些照片，庆祝她的生日。
My dear grandmother is almost 100 years old, and I'd like to have her photographed to celebrate her birthday.

7.
Wow! What a fabulous milestone! That's a wonderful way to celebrate her birthday. Would you like to include other family members in the photos?
哇！这可是一个了不起的里程碑/大事啊！用这种方式庆祝她的生日可太棒了。你想让其他家人一起入镜吗？

8.
是的，她特别希望和孙辈们一起合影，对她来说，这很重要。但孙辈们还太小，可能以后记不住她了。
Yes, she really wants to have photos taken with her grandchildren. It means a lot to her. But her grandchildren are still so young that they might not remember her in the future.

9.
Of course. It's such a good idea. Sounds like you'd prefer a cozy, candid family shoot rather than formal portraits, is that right?
当然啦。这主意真好。听起来你更想要温馨自然的家庭照，而不是正式的人像照，对吧？

10.
是的，我想在家里拍一些可爱的随意的照片。我不想要正式的摆拍的照片，那样每个人看上去都不自在。
Yes, I'd like to take some lovely, casual photos at home. I don't want formal, posed pictures because they make everyone look uncomfortable.

11.
Absolutely! Formal photos are not necessarily unnatural, but I do find people nowadays prefer a natural, relaxed look in their photos.
完全理解！正式照也不一定会不自然，不过我确实发现，现在的人更喜欢自然随性的照片。

12.
请问你有摄影的价格表吗？这样我可以看看不同的拍摄方案，决定选择拍哪种类型。
Do you have a photography price list? That way I can look at the different session options and decide which type to book.

13.
Yes! I'll send it to you. We actually have some special deal sessions at the moment, so I'll include those too.
当然！我会把价格表发给你。我们现在正好有一些优惠拍摄套餐，我也一并发你。

14.
谢谢你的帮助。我先看看价格表，等我准备好预定了，再给你打电话。
Thanks for your help! I'll take a look at the price list, and I'll call you when I'm ready to book.
