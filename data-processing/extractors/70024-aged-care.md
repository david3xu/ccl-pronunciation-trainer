#70024. Aged Care - Social Welfare

1.
Hello, Mr. Liu. I'm here to do a home visit so that we can know more about your living needs. What type of assistance do you think you need? We want to prepare a plan for you.
您好，刘先生。我来做家访，这样我们可以更多地了解您的生活需求。您认为您需要什么类型的帮助呢？我们想为您准备一个计划。

2.
您好啊。谢谢您的关心。我老伴一年前去世了，我还有心脏病，有时候会没力气。所以做家务和做饭这些对我有点困难。
Hello. Thank you for asking. My wife passed away one year ago. I have a heart disease and sometimes I feel weak. Therefore, it can be a little difficult for me when it comes to things like doing housework and cooking.

3.
I'm sorry to hear that. You do have a very lovely porch with a great view. I can see why you enjoy living near the coast. However, it's a bit far from suburban areas so food delivery may be a problem.
听到这些我很遗憾。您有个很漂亮的门廊，景色也很美。我可以理解您为什么喜欢住在海边。不过，这里离城郊有些远，所以送餐可能是个问题。

4.
是啊，我女儿刘丽有时候会来看我，会带一些冷冻食品。但是她过来要开一个小时的车呢。她让我搬去和她一起住，但是我在这里住的很开心。
Yes. My daughter Liu Li visits me sometimes and she would bring some frozen foods. However, it takes an hour for her to drive here. She asked me to move in with her, but I'm having a good time living here.

5.
Well people can be attached to a place where they have lived long. It sounds like your daughter is very considerate and caring. She made this appointment with me, but she can't make it today. I heard that it seems one of her children is sick.
是的。当人在一个地方住久了，是会有感情的。听起来您的女儿非常体贴，非常照顾您呢。她约了跟我今天见面，但是她今天来不了了。我听说好像她的一个孩子生病了。

6.
是啊。我孙女昨天晚上发高烧，并且耳朵疼。我女儿是个好孩子，不过她自己的工作和家庭都很忙，所以她都自顾不暇了，也没办法像她想的那样经常来看我。
Yes. My granddaughter had a high-grade fever last night and her ears ached. My daughter is a good child, but she's busy with her work and her family. She can hardly look after herself, so she's not able to come and visit me as often as she wants.

7.
Yes, I can totally understand that. It can be hard to juggle between work and family. So, do you have any friends or acquaintances in the area?
是的。我完全可以理解。在工作和家庭之间兼顾是很难的。那么您在这边有朋友或者熟人吗？

8.
有啊。我一周和朋友出去吃一顿饭，也有送餐公司一周送三次饭。剩余的时间我就自己做饭。
Yes. I eat out with friends once every week. The meals delivery company also delivers three times a week. I'll cook for the rest of the time.

9.
Well, you probably know that seniors who are 60 years of age and older who are homebound or unable to shop and cook are eligible to receive Meals on Wheels. I'm glad to see that you are in sound health.
您也许知道，六十岁以上的老年人，如果在家不便，或者不能购物和做饭，是有资格享受送餐服务的。我很高兴看到您身体很好。

10.
是啊，我很喜欢做简单的饭菜，比如香肠和鸡蛋等等。日子过的虽然有点孤独，但也算悠然自得吧。
Yes. I really like to cook some simple meals like sausages and eggs. Life is a bit lonely, but it agrees with me.

11.
It's great to hear that. I'll put all this into your profile when I get back to the office. It's nice talking with you and if you have any questions or needs, please feel free to contact us.
听到这个很好啊。等我回到办公室，我会把这些都记在您的档案里的。跟您聊天很愉快。如果您有任何问题或者需要，请尽管联系我们啊。

12.
好的，今天和您聊天我也很愉快。您慢走。
Okay. It's nice talking to you too today. Have a good day.
