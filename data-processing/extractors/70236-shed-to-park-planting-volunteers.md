#70236. Shed to Park: Planting Volunteers - Social

1.
Hey there, come on in! I heard you were asking about volunteering opportunities. We'd love to tell you more about how you can get involved.
你好，快请进！我听说你在打听志愿者机会。我们很乐意多给你讲讲怎么参与。

2.
对的，我刚搬来一个月左右。想找点事儿做，好尽快熟悉这一片儿。毕竟新地方嘛，多认识点邻居挺好的。
Yep, I just moved here about a month ago. Trying to find things to do to get to know the area sooner. After all, it's a new place and it's nice to meet more neighbors.

3.
We're always looking for people to help out with our activities. Honestly, volunteers help everything we do here. We really couldn't manage without them!
我们一直在找人给活动帮忙。说真的，我们所有工作都有志愿者帮忙。没有他们真忙不过来。

4.
我在家办公，所以时间安排挺自由的。每周都能抽出几个小时帮忙。说实话，我主要想多认识些人。
I work from home, so my schedule's pretty flexible. I can spare a few hours every week to volunteer. Honestly, I mainly want to meet more new people.

5.
Absolutely! Lots of our volunteers end up becoming friends. Is there anything specific you enjoy doing? We'll try to match you with a project that suits your hobbies.
当然！很多志愿者最后都成了朋友。你有什么特别喜欢做的吗？我们会尽量按你的兴趣匹配项目。

6.
我什么都愿意试试，不过我确实特别喜欢园艺，还有种植。最近，我还在家搞了个小菜园呢。
I'm open to anything, but I'm indeed into gardening and planting stuff. I've been working on a little veggie garden at home lately.

7.
That's perfect! We actually have an ideal project. We're fixing up that park next to the mall. Your skills would be a great fit there.
真好！实际上我们有个项目很合适。我们在修缮商场旁边那个公园。你的特长在那儿完全能用上。

8.
我都不知道那儿有个公园呢，一直以为就是块空地。这消息还挺让人惊喜的！
I had no idea there was a park there – I always thought it was just an empty lot. That's really nice to hear!

9.
Right now, we need helpers to look after the seedlings in our shed before planting them in the park. When they're strong enough, they'll be moved to the park.
现在，我们需要帮手在我们的棚子里照看那些树苗，之后再把它们种到公园里。等它们长得足够结实了，就挪到公园里去。

10.
这事儿我能行！种本地植物，我特别乐意帮忙。而且我能看出这个公园修缮后一定会很漂亮。
I can totally do this! Planting native plants—I'd be really happy to help. And I can tell this park will look so nice once it's fixed up.

11.
It's a big project for sure, but it'll be worth it when we see the results. We'll also be installing some benches so people can relax there.
工程肯定不小，但看到成果就值了。我们还会装些长椅，方便大家休息。

12.
公园对咱们社区居民可重要了。大伙儿总得有个地方散步，或者单纯坐着透透气吧。
Parks are quite important to people in our community. Everyone needs a spot to take walks or just sit and get some fresh air.

13.
Definitely! We got really lucky to have raised lots of community donations to restore the park. The whole neighborhood's keen to see it open again.
没错！这次公园改造能筹到很多社区捐款，真是太幸运了。整个社区都盼着看到它重新开放呢。

14.
能帮着重建公园，我特别开心。感觉这个项目特别有意义，让每个人都很有成就感。
Being able to help rebuild the park makes me really happy. I feel this project is really meaningful — it gives everyone a sense of accomplishment.
