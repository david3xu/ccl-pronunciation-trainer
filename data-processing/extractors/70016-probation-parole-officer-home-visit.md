#70016. Probation and Parole Officer Home Visit - Legal

1.
Good Morning, Mr. Huang. I'm Jane and I'm a probation and parole officer. I'm here to do a home visit and discuss your son Tony.
早上好，黄先生。我是简，是一名缓刑和假释官。我今天是来做家访的，并且要跟你讨论一下你儿子托尼的事情。

2.
警官你好，请进吧。请问我儿子Tony在监狱一切都还好吗？
Hello, officer. Please come in. Is everything in prison okay for Tony, if I may ask?

3.
Don't worry, he's fine. His parole has been granted. He gave this address to us before his trial as his residential address. After he's release, is he going to live here with you?
别担心。他很好。他的假释已经被批准了。在他庭审之前，他把这个地址作为他的居住地址给了我们。在他释放以后，他会跟你一起住在这吗？

4.
这是他的家，所以他当然还会住在这里。我们能去监狱接他吗？还有什么是我们能做的吗？我们一定尽力配合。
This is his home, so he will live here for sure. Can we pick him up in prison? Is there anything else we could do? We'll definitely try our best to cooperate.

5.
You need to pick him up. Now I need to inspect his room and the house. After he's released, he will need to wear an electronic monitoring device on his ankle all times so that we can track his location.
你需要去接他。现在我需要检查他的房间和这个房子。在他释放以后，他需要一直在脚踝上佩戴一个电子监控设备，以便我们追踪他的定位/位置。

6.
好的。我给您带路，这是他的房间，他有自己的电视，电脑。他会一个人好好住在这里。我们说什么也不会再让他的狐朋狗友来找他了。
Okay. I'll show you the way. This is his room. He has his own TV and computer. He will live here obediently, just himself. We'll never allow his bad friends to come and visit him anymore.

7.
Good. He also needs to abide by the conditions attached to his parole, including a curfew, which means he can't leave the premise between 9pm to 5am.
很好。他还需要遵守他的假释附带的条件，包括宵禁，也就是说从晚上九点到早上五点之间，他不得离开住所。

8.
好的，我们也会监督他的。那他白天可以离开家，是吗？他能工作吗？我表弟可以找个砌砖的活儿给他做，别让他太闲了。
Okay. We'll also supervise him. He can leave home during the day, right? Can he work? My cousin can find a brick-laying job for him to keep him busy.

9.
Yes, he can work. Though we'll need the full details of your cousin. Apart from that, Tony needs to report to his parole officer on a regular basis.
是的，他可以工作的。不过我们需要你表弟的所有信息资料。除此之外，托尼还需要定期向他的假释官报告。

10.
好的，我跟我表弟说说，他一定会理解的。还有，警察会定期来检查我儿子吗？我怕邻居们说闲话。
Okay. I'll talk with my cousin. I'm sure he'll understand. Also, will the police check on my son regularly? I'm worried that the neighbors will gossip.

11.
According to the Adult Parole Board, the officer will show up unannounced to check on him as he has been charged with drug trafficking. It's a very serious crime.
根据成人假释委员会的规定，假释官来检查他是不会事先通知的。这是因为他被指控贩毒。这是非常严重的罪行。

12.
天呐，真不敢相信我的儿子会跟毒贩扯上关系。真是羞耻啊。但是不管怎样，我们还是爱他的，毕竟是我们的亲生儿子。
Gosh！I can't believe my son could be related to a drug dealer! I feel so ashamed. But no matter what, we'll still love him. After all, he's our own son.
