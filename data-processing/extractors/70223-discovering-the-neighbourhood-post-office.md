#70223. Discovering the Neighbourhood Post Office - Business

1.
Hi there, I'm Robin. I just saw a moving van parked around here earlier, and I thought I'd come and say hi.
你好，我是罗宾。我刚看到这附近停着一辆搬家货车，就想过来打个招呼。

2.
你好呀！我是刚搬来的，现在屋里还乱着呢，箱子还有一半没拆完，家具也堆得乱七八糟。
Hi there! I just moved in. The place is still a mess: boxes half-unpacked and furniture everywhere.

3.
Moving is always hectic, especially when you want to get every little thing in order. But I'm sure you'll settle in quickly!
搬家确实很忙活，尤其是把每件小东西都摆整齐。不过我相信你肯定很快就能适应啦！

4.
谢谢你！这里生活起来很舒服。我很喜欢周围的环境。我迫不及待想在周边转转了
Thank you! This place feels really livable. I love the surroundings. I can't wait to explore around.

5.
When you're all set, maybe we can grab some coffee at the business center? They've got some great little shops too.
等你都安顿好了，咱俩可以去商业中心喝咖啡？那儿还有不少不错的小店。

6.
好呀！太棒了！对了，商业中心里头有邮局吗？要是有的话，对我来说就太方便啦。
Sure! That'd be great! By the way, is there a post office in the business center? If so, that'd be super handy for me.

7.
Yep! It's on the first floor, all the way in the back. The people working there are really helpful.
有的！就在一楼最里头。那儿的工作人员也非常热心。

8.
我前阵子在电视上还看到，商业中心的邮局还卖各种东西，甚至有文具。
I saw on TV recently that the post office in the business center sells all sorts of items, even stationery.

9.
That's right! They sell all kinds of things, even gifts like souvenirs and greeting cards.
没错！他们啥都卖，连礼物都有，比如纪念品啊，贺卡什么的。

10.
他们有没有那种给小孩子用的毛毯？我想给女儿买一条，让她更快习惯新房间。
Do they sell blankets for kids? I'd like to get one for my daughter so she can feel more at home in her new room.

11.
That sounds perfect! Go have a look! They usually have super cute ones with cartoon prints.
听上去很棒！你去看看就知道啦。他们那儿经常有印着卡通图案的可爱毯子。

12.
那我可要经常去转转了，期待体验一下那里的服务和商品。
Then I should go check it out often. I'm looking forward to trying their services and seeing what they sell.

13.
Mornings tend to be less busy. The lines are shorter and it's less crowded before the lunch rush.
通常早上人比较少，排队短，中午饭点儿之前的那阵子，人会更少。

14.
这些信息太有帮助了。罗宾，认识你真好。我一安顿好，就请你去喝咖啡！
The information is so helpful. Robin, it's really nice meeting you. Coffee's on me once I'm all settled!
