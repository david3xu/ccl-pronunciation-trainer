#70021. Report a Phone Scam - Legal

1.
Hello, my name is Henry. I'm a senior police officer from Sunshine Coast police station. How can I help you today?
你好。我是亨利。我是阳光海岸警察局的高级警官。我今天能如何为你效劳呢？

2.
你好，我昨天接到一个自称是移民局的电话，说我涉嫌诈骗，已经成了全球通缉犯，并且不可以出境了。
Hello. I received a phone call yesterday saying that he's calling from the Department of Home Affairs. He said that I was suspected of fraud and I was now globally wanted, and I was not allowed to leave the country.

3.
That's not true. It is a scam. We have received many cases like this recently. This is a phone scam. They ask people to add them in WeChat, and transfer money to them as a fine.
这是假的。这是诈骗。我们最近接到了很多这样的案子。这是一个电话诈骗。他们还让人们在微信上加他们，然后转钱给他们，作为罚款。

4.
是啊，他们还问我银行账户信息。他们让我每天登陆微信，汇报每天的行程。还让我在手机上下载一个软件。
Yes. They asked me about my bank account information. They asked me to log on my WeChat everyday and report my whereabouts every day. They also asked me to download an application on my phone.

5.
May I have a look at your phone? Then I can check the communication history between you and the scammer, but I don't know what program he asked you to install.
我可以看一眼你的电话吗？这样我可以看一下你和诈骗犯之间的聊天记录。不过我不太清楚他让你安装什么程序呢？

6.
好的，就是这个软件。你看吧。那我银行资料和里面的钱怎么办？我需要通知银行这件事吗？我需要卸载这个软件吗？
Okay. It's just this one. Take your time. What about my bank account information and the money in it? Do I need to notify the bank about this? Do I need to uninstall this application?

7.
No, they will ask you to transfer money to them by Western Union. And because you haven't done this, your money in your bank should be safe. As for the app, I suggest you go to the phone store to do a restore and then delete it professionally.
不。他们会让你通过西联汇款转钱给他们转钱。而且因为你还没转，你银行里的钱应该是安全的。至于那个程序，我建议你去手机店复原一下手机，用专业手段把那个程序删掉。

8.
如果是这样，那我就放心多了。我一会儿就去手机店把这个软件卸载了。
I feel much relieved if that's the case. I'll go to a phone store to uninstall that application.

9.
Ok. I will send the screenshot of the chat history via email for detection. Then the investigation can be conducted according to the information obtained from the chat history.
好的。我会把聊天记录的截图用邮件发过来检查一下的。然后就可以根据聊天记录里面获取的信息进行调查。

10.
这些人真的是太贼了！我需不需要跟中国的警察报案？这样的话，中国警察可以追踪他们的电话号码，然后尽快抓到他们。
They are so sneaky! Do I need to report to the police in China? In that case, their phone number can be traced, and they can be caught as soon as possible.

11.
That is definitely a good idea and your report will help them with the investigation.
这绝对是个好主意。你去报案也可以帮助他们调查。

12.
谢谢你今天的帮助。我也要告诉我的朋友，以防他们遭受同样的情况。
Thank you for your help today. I'll tell my friends in case they have the same experience.
