#70017. Parent-Teacher Interview - Education

1.
老师您好，您叫我来开家长会有什么急事吗？我最近工作很忙的。
Hello. You asked me for this parent-teacher interview. Is there anything urgent? I've been really busy with work recently.

2.
I'm sorry to tell you that your son seems to have some problems with study recently. He failed his chemistry and physics examinations.
很遗憾地告诉您，您儿子最近似乎学习上有些问题。他的化学和物理考试都没有及格。

3.
天啊，这真是晴天霹雳。我儿子在家说过这两门学起来很困难。他在课上认真听讲吗？
Gosh! It's so shocking/it's such shocking news/it's a bolt out of the blue! My son said at home that these two subjects were difficult to learn. Does he listen carefully in class?

4.
Well, that's another thing I want to discuss with you about. It seems that he finds it difficult to concentrate in class. I often find him absent-minded or even dozing off.
嗯，这是我想跟您讨论的另一件事。他似乎很难在课上集中注意力。我总看到他开小差，甚至打瞌睡。

5.
除了课上走神开小差，打瞌睡，他还会在课上跟同学说话，打扰别人吗？如果他上课好好听讲，成绩有可能提高吗？
Apart from being absent-minded and dozing off in class, does he talk to his classmates or disturb others? Would his grades increase if he listens carefully in class?

6.
If he could stay more focused and talk less in class, there's still room for improvement. He also needs to finish his homework on time.
如果他可以在课上更集中注意力，少讲话的话，他的成绩就还有提高的空间。他还需要按时完成作业。

7.
真是惭愧啊，我和孩子父亲最近工作太忙了，都没顾得上管他。今天回家我会跟他好好谈一谈的。我保证他按照老师您说的去做。
I feel really ashamed. His father and I have been too busy with work recently to have time for him. I'll have a good talk with him today after I get back. I promise he'll do as you asked.

8.
I'm glad to hear that. We can have another parent-teacher interview next month to update his progress. I hope we can work together to improve his academic performance.
很高兴听到这个。下个月我们可以再开一次家长会来跟进一下他的情况。我希望我们可以一起努力，把他的学习成绩提上来。

9.
好的老师，我会找我侄子再给他补习补习物理化学的。我侄子大学学的就是物理专业，之前也是精英学校的好学生。
Okay. I'll ask my nephew to tutor him in physics and chemistry. Physics is his major at his university. He also used to be a good student at a selective school.

10.
That's good. I also suggest you have a good talk with him regularly, often ask him how he is doing and show him that you care deeply about him.
那很好。我还建议你们跟他定期好好聊一聊，经常问问他最近怎么样，让他知道你们非常关心他。

11.
老师您说的对，这个年纪的青少年多少都有些叛逆。我们会好好关心他，督促他。
You are right. Teenagers at this age can be more or less rebellious. We'll take good care of him and encourage him.

12.
Great. Please feel free to contact me if you have any problems.
很好。如果你们有任何问题，请尽管联系我。
