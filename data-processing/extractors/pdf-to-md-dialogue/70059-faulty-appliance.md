# 70059. Faulty appliance - Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking clerk and a mandarin-speaking woman who needs to replace a faulty electrical appliance. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning. What can I do for you today?  
(早上好。今天我能为您做些什么呢？)

2. 你好。前几天我在你们店里买了一个电器，但是我觉得它可能是坏的，所以我拿过来让您看看。  
(Hello. I bought an appliance from you several days ago. However, I don't think it's working properly. So I brought it here for you to have a look.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
电器：appliance (可数名词)  
某东西是坏的：It's not working (properly)/it's broken.

3. Okay. Let me have a look. What seems to be the problem? By the way, have you brought in the receipt?  
(好的。让我看一眼。您觉得哪里出问题了呢？对了，您带收据了吗？)

4. 有的，在我包里。我在家想用这个电器煮东西，插上电以后，它一点反应也没有。您可以试试看。  
(Yes, it's in my bag. When I was planning to cook with it at home, it didn't respond at all after I plugged it in. Feel free to have a try.)

5. Well, let's plug it into the power board at the counter. This way, please.  
(嗯，我们去收银台那边拿插线板插上电看看吧。您这边请。)

6. 你看，插了电，按了开关以后，它还是什么反应也没有，就跟我在家里用的时候一样。 真是很烦人啊。  
(Well, see, we've plugged it in and we've pressed the switch, it's still not responding. It's exactly like when I was using it at home. It's so annoying.)

7. It does seem faulty. There's probably an electrical fault. Anyway, you have two choices now: we can give you a refund, or you can replace it with another product.  
(看上去，它确实是出问题了。可能是有什么电路故障。不管怎么说呢，您现在有两个方案：或者是我们给您退款；或者我们给您更换成别的产品。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Electrical fault: a fault caused by something electrical. 电路故障例句：火灾被认为是电路故障引起的：The fire was believed to have been caused by an electrical fault.

8. 我还是想换货，因为我确实需要这个电器。换货的话一定是换同样的牌子吗？还是可以选别的牌子？  
(I still want a replacement because I do need this appliance. Do I have to replace it with a product from the same brand, or may I choose other brands?)

9. You can choose a replacement of the same product from a different brand. If it's the same price, we'll just swap them over. If it's more expensive, you just need to pay the difference. If it's cheaper, we'll refund you the difference or give you store credit.  
(您可以换成不同牌子的同类产品，如果价格一样的话，我们直接帮你换就可以了。如果您选的产品价格更高，您需要付一下差价。如果您价格更低，我们可以给您退还差价，或者给您店铺积分。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Store credit: a document offered by a store to a customer who returns an item not eligible for a refund. It can be used to buy other goods at the store. 店铺积分

10. 那我还是换一个牌子吧。我怕同样的牌子会有类似的问题。我看那边有个同类的产品，好像价格也一样，不过是另一个牌子的呢。  
(A different brand then. I'm worried that the same problem may occur if it's from the same brand. I just saw a similar product over there and seems it's the same price. It's from another brand though.)

11. Sure. Would you mind taking the product from the shelf and bring it to the counter? I'll be happy to check the price and work out the payment for you.  
(当然可以了。您可以从架子上拿一下产品，然后把它拿到柜台这里吗？我会非常乐意帮您看一下价格的，再看看咱们怎么算钱。)

12. 太好了！谢谢你！你真的很帮忙。  
(Great！ Thank you so much! You've been really helpful.)
