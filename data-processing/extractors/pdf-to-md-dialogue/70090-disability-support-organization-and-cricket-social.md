# 70090. Disability support organization and cricket - Social

**Briefing:** This phone conversation is between a Mandarin-speaking potential client and an English-speaking staff from a disability support organization. The client wants to see if there're any support program services for his brother who has disabilities. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning, Paul speaking. How can I help you?
(早上好，我是保罗。我能怎么帮助您呢？)

2. 你好，保罗。我今天打电话是想问问有没有什么帮助服务可以提供给我兄弟，他有残疾。
(Hello, Paul. I called today to see if there're any support program services for my brother who has disabilities.)

3. Sure！We have social groups，sports groups and employment groups, and we also provide support for families and carers.
(当然啦。我们有社交小组，体育小组和求职小组，我们还为家人和照顾者提供帮助。)

4. 他今年 28 岁了，他希望能多认识一些同龄的有残疾的朋友。
(He's 28 this year and he wants to know more friends of his age who also have disabilities.)

5. Ok. Then the social group may be good for him. The group has people from 20-30 years old. It's on Wednesday every week, from 6-8 pm.
(好的。那社交小组应该对他来说是不错的。这个小组里的成员都是 20-30 岁左右，时间是每周三的晚上 6-8 点。)

6. 那听起来太棒了，我会问问他是不是感兴趣的。他很害羞, 所以他可能会感觉到焦虑。
(That sounds great. I'll see if he's interested. He's quite shy, so he may feel anxious.)

7. That's fine. We also have supportive social workers who can take good care of him. It's a nice group and I'm sure he will make lots of friends.
(没关系的。我们的社工都很帮忙的，他们会好好照顾他的。这个小组很不错，我相信他能交到很多朋友的。)

8. 谢谢你，能交到朋友就太好了。他对运动很感兴趣，尤其是板球
(Thank you. That would be great if he gets to make some friends. He's keen on sports, especially cricket.)

9. We have cricket, tennis and soccer every Saturday. He's welcomed to play just for fun, or he can also join one of the competition groups.
(我们每周六都有板球，网球和英式足球。我们欢迎他来，可以打着玩，或者也可以参加一个我们的竞技小组。)

10. 太好了，他喜欢板球, 经常打。我想他会很乐意加入这个小组的。
(That's great. He's keen on cricket and he plays it all the time. I think he'll love to join this group.)

11. That's great！We are looking for new players, and our next cricket program will start in 2 weeks. You can sign up now if you like.
(太好啦。我们也在找新的队员。我们下个板球项目两周后就开始了。如果你想的话，可以现在就报名。)

12. 谢谢，请给他留个位置吧。那他需要什么特殊装备或者运动服吗?
(Thank you. Please do save a place for him. Does he need any special equipment or sweats?)

13. We have all the equipment here，but he does need an uniform. I will give u all the information on Wednesday.
(我们这儿所有的装备都有的，不过他确实需要一套制服。周三的时候我把所有的信息都给你。)

14. 这正是我们想要的，我很高兴我找到了你。我都迫不及待想要告诉他了。
(That's exactly what we want. I'm glad that I find you. I can't wait to tell him.)

15. I'm glad that you find us as well. I'm looking forward to seeing both of you on Wednesday.
(我也很高兴你找到我们了。期待周三见到你们俩。)

16. 谢谢你的帮助，保罗。
(Thanks for your help, Paul.)
