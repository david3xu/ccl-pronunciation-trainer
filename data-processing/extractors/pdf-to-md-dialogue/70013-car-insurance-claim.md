#70013. Car Insurance Claim - Business

1.
Hello, thank you for calling RACV insurance company. This is Amy from the claims team. How can I help you?
你好，感谢致电维多利亚州皇家汽车俱乐部保险公司。我是艾米，来自索赔组/团队。我有什么可以帮您的吗？

2.
您好，我是王伟，我的保单号是T193，我想要申请理赔，因为我昨天出了车祸。
Hello, this is Wei Wang. My policy number is T193. I'd like to make a claim because I had a car accident yesterday.

3.
Thanks for providing your policy number. Let me get your policy from the system. Okay, please tell me exactly what happened.
感谢您提供的保单号码。让我从系统里把您的保单调/找出来。好啦，请告诉我当时究竟发生了什么呢？

4.
昨晚回家的路上，我们前面的车突然一个急刹车，我们来不及刹车，就追尾了。我的前车灯和保险杠全撞坏了。好在没人受伤。
Last night, on the way home, the car in front of us suddenly braked. We rear-ended the car before we had time to stop/brake. My headlights and bumper were all crashed. Luckily no one was injured.

5.
Do you know the Registration number, make or model of the other car? Did you exchange your contact details and driving license with the other driver?
您知道另一辆车的车牌号，牌子或者型号吗？您和另一位司机交换了电话和驾照信息吗？

6.
都有的。他在玩手机，没有看路。我买的是全险。索赔应该没有问题吧？
Yes. He was playing on his mobile phone and didn't keep his eyes on the road/wasn't paying attention to the road. I'm a comprehensive car insurance policy holder. I guess it shouldn't be a problem for me to make a claim, right?

7.
Well, we still need to contact the other driver's insurer to get the other side of the story before making a decision about the claim.
这个嘛，在决定理赔之前，我们还需要联系另一位驾驶员的保险公司，了解一下那边的说法。

8.
哦，他说追尾是因为我们没有注意我们前面的车的状况。可惜当时没有证人。我们也没装行车记录仪。
Well, he said that the rear-end collision occured because we weren't paying attention to the car in front of us. Unfortunately, there was no witness and we don't have a dashcam/dash camera.

9.
Don't worry, we'll carefully consider both sides of the story and make a fair decision. Were you driving the vehicle?
别担心。我们会仔细考虑两头的说法，作出公正的决断的。是您开的车吗？

10.
并不是。是我儿子开的车。他刚刚拿到全驾照，我让他开车，想让他增加一下开高速的经验。
Not really. It was my son. He just got his full license. I asked him to drive so that he could gain more experience of driving on the freeway.

11.
According to what I can see from here, your son's name is not listed on your policy. If your son is under 25, you will need to pay a $600 excess fee if he is at fault.
根据我这边可以看到的信息，您儿子的名字不在您的保险单名单上。如果您儿子小于25岁并且是过错方的话，您需要交600元的保险自付费/保险启动费/保险垫底费。

12.
真倒霉，他刚刚23岁。算了，您帮我赶快处理了吧，我不想再惹麻烦。
That's bad luck. He's only 23. Never mind, please help me settle this. I don't want any more trouble.

13.
We will solve this issue as soon as possible and contact you immediately.
我们会尽快解决这件事，然后迅速联系您的。
