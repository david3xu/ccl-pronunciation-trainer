Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking clerk at the Department of housing and a mandarin speaking man, whose house has been burnt down. The dialogue starts now.

1. 请帮帮我吧！我们现在居无定所，无家可归啊！我现在上无片瓦盖身，下无立锥之地。
(Please help us! We have no place to go and nowhere to stay! I'm completely homeless now!)

上面这句谚语翻译，口译考试时先确保准确，

66. Please Calm down and tell me what happened. We'll try our best to help you.
(请您冷静，告诉我发生了什么。我们会尽力帮您的。)

67. 我家着火了，房子也塌了。火是从厨房烧起来的，然后很快就蔓延到整个房子了。不过我和我妻子没事。
(Our house was on fire and then it collapsed. The fire started from the kitchen and then it quickly spread through the entire house. My wife and I are okay though.)

着火：Something catches/is on fire，例句：The house caught/was on fire. 房子着火
灭火：put out a fire，例句：The firemen put on the fire. 消防员把火灭了。 灭火器 ：fire extinguisher

68. I'm so sorry to hear that. We'll do whatever we can to help you. Has anyone else been affected? Where's your wife? Did you call the fire brigade?
(听到这个消息我非常抱歉。我们会尽我们所能来帮您的。火灾波及到其他人了吗？您的妻子在哪呢？您给消防队打电话了吗？)

69. 当时我的邻居帮我打电话了。我的妻子受到了很大的惊吓，现在我邻居正在照顾她。我们刚来澳大利亚，我们唯一的儿子在国外留学。请您帮我们找找住的地方吧！
(My neighbor called the fire brigade for us. My wife has been shocked, and my neighbor is taking care of her now. We have just arrived in Australia and our only son is studying overseas. Please help us to find a place to live!)

Fire brigade: 消防队
help sb to do sth 和 help sb do sth 都可以

70. We do have emergency accommodation to assist you. Please calm down and fill out these forms. Could you please first write down your current address, contact details, your son's address, email and phone number? Where's your son?
(我们有确实有应急住处来帮您度过难关。请您冷静一下，把这些表格填了。您可以先写一下您的现住址，联系方式，您儿子的住址，邮箱和电话号码吗？您的儿子在哪呢？)

71. 他在西班牙马德里读书，我只能给你他的手机号码。我能借用一下你的手机，给他打个电话吗？我的手机也被烧坏了。
(He's now studying in Madrid in Spain. His phone number is the only thing that I'm able to give you. May I borrow your phone to give him a call? My phone was damaged as well.)

72. I think we can definitely organize that with my manager. Do you have your passport with you?
(您的这个要求，我想我们一定可以跟我的经理协商安排的。您带护照了吗？)

73. 有的。幸好我把护照带在身边了。可是我没有邮箱。
(Yes. Thankfully, I've brought it with me. But I don't have an email.)

74. Don't worry. We'll contact your son as soon as possible to see if he could come back temporarily to help with this crisis.
(别担心。我们会尽快联系您的儿子，看他能不能临时赶回来，帮你们共度难关。)

11. 这次意外可能会影响到我儿子的学习，但是也没办法了。谢谢你们在最紧急的时候给我们提供帮助。
(This accident may affect his study. But we don't have any other options. Thank you for helping us when we are in desperate need of help.)

75. You're welcome. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.
(不客气的。如果您有别的问题，尽管联系我们。)
