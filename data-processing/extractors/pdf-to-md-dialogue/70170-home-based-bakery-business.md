你好，克莉丝汀。我想在家里开一个食品生意，我想要了解，市政厅在这方面有什么规定。
Hi, Christine. I want to start a food business from home, and I'd like to understand the council regulations for it.

3.
Sounds exciting! I can give you some general information. Can you tell me what type of food you're planning to sell?

我想做一些蛋糕和饼干，并通过网上商店和实体店来卖它们。
I want to make cakes and cookies and sell them through an online store and a local shop.

Ok. Firstly, the council requires you to have a permit to sell food.
好的。首先，市政要求您持有销售食品的许可。

我不确定需要提供什么信息给市政厅，您能给我解释一下吗？
I'm not sure what information I need to provide to the council. Could you explain?

You need to include details of your products and the ingredients you're going to use. You'll also need a permit to prepare them.

我会的，我会在家里的厨房里备料和烘焙。我还知道会有检查。

Yes, that's right. A council officer will come to inspect your kitchen to ensure it meets food business standards.
是的，您说得对。市政工作人员会到您家里检查厨房，以确保符合食品经营的标准。

好的，厨房里有足够的空间来备料，我也会保持厨房的整洁，希望我能够达到许可的标准。
Alright, my kitchen has enough space for preparation, and I'll keep it clean. I hope I can meet the permit requirements.

You'll also need proper storage. I'll send you an information pack that explains exactly what you need to do to get a permit.
您还需要有适当的储存空间。我会寄给您一份信息包，里面会详细说明如何获得许可证。
