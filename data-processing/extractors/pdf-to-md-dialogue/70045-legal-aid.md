# 70045. Legal Aid - Legal

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Mr. Shi, a mandarin speaking client, and a legal-aid lawyer. Mr. Shi is making an initial consultation regarding his legal aid application. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good afternoon, Mr. Shi. First, I want to ask you a few routine questions. Can I confirm with you that you'd like to apply for Legal Aid?
(施/史先生，下午好。首先，我要问你几个常规问题。我跟你确认一下: 你要申请法律援助吗？)

11. 当然了。我本来想请私人律师，但是我的餐厅生意不好，赚钱不多，我也没有多少存款。我所有的钱都用来养家糊口了。
(Sure. I planned to engage a private lawyer; however, my restaurant is not running well and it's not making a lot of money. I don't have too much money saved. All my money is used to support/feed the family.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Savings 作为存款/积蓄的时候要用复数；"savings" (total amount. saved) is countable in some but not all grammatical contexts. And that we normally avoid the uncountable use. 请律师 往往习惯说 engage a lawyer, 而不是 hire a lawyer.

3. Okay. You can then fill in this application form after this consultation. According to the court summons, you are charged with handling stolen goods and possession of suspected stolen goods.
(好的。那么在这次咨询结束后，你可以填一下这个申请表。根据法院传票，你被指控处理赃物以及持有疑似赃物。)

12. 我冤枉啊！当我在警察局做口供的时候，我就说过。那天是端午节，我们一家人正在吃粽子，突然警察就来到我家，指控我们处理赃物。太可怕了。
(I'm so wronged! I explained this when I was giving a statement in the police station. It was the Dragon Boat Festival, and my family and I were eating Zongzi. All of a sudden, the police came to my home and charged us with handling stolen goods. It's so scary.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
You can refer to the official account of events which a suspect or a witness gives to the police as a statement. (嫌犯或证人向警方提供的) 陈述; 证词；口供。例：The 350-page report was based on statements from witnesses to the events. 这份 350 页的报告基于该事件目击者的证词

13. According to the paperwork, you have large amount of second hand electrical appliances stocked in your restaurant's store room. Could you please explain why you have them and what they're used for?
(根据文件显示，你把大量二手家电囤积在你餐厅的储藏室里。你可以解释一下你为什么会有这些家电，以及这些家电是用来做什么的吗？)

14. 我真是有口也说不清啊！那天，一群年轻的地痞流氓突然闯进我的餐厅，逼我买二手家电。他们还威胁我说，如果我不全部买下来，他们就要砸烂我的餐厅。
(I feel so wronged! A group of young thugs/gangsters stormed/rushed into my restaurant that day and forced me to buy some used/second hand home appliances. They threatened me that they would smash my restaurant if I didn't buy them all.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
有口说不清，还是冤枉，跳进黄河洗不清的意思，so不建议翻"I can't explain it"，依然要把委屈冤枉的感觉翻出来。可以说：I feel so wronged!或者 I feel so falsely/wrongly accused!或者 Now it seems futile for me to argue.

7. The police have already arrested those young people. They have confessed that they stole these from the nearby apartments. Well, it was alleged that you purchased stolen goods at a low price and resold them to make profit. Did you know that that is illegal?
(警察已经逮捕了这些年轻人。他们承认他们是在附近的公寓偷盗了这些家电。据说你低价购入赃物，之后再重新卖掉来赚钱/获利。你知道这是违法的吗？)

【萤火虫老师 tips】
Despite the repetition, 'that' is better than 'it' – we're not replacing a noun with a pronoun, we're referring back to a whole clause.

8. 我也是没办法啊！那群小混混老是来我的餐厅。这些地痞流氓让我太害怕了。他们对移民有偏见。吃完饭，我让他们付钱，他们经常就走掉了。
(I really had no choice! Those hooligans always came to my restaurant. I'm so scared of these thugs/gangsters. They have prejudice against migrants. After they finished their meals and when I asked them to pay, they always just left.)

15. You must understand that if you are found guilty, you may receive penalties such as a fine, Good Behavior Bond or community service, or even a prison sentence.
(你一定得明白，如果你被判有罪，你可能面临的处罚有：罚款，守行令，或者社区服务，甚至监狱服刑。)

16. 这太可怕了！我没有任何前科。要是我能有资格获得法律援助，我希望你们可以出庭帮我打官司。
(That's so scary! I don't have any previous criminal records. I hope that you can appear in court and help me with my case if I'm eligible for legal aid.)

17. We are more than happy to start helping you after you have been granted with legal aid.
(在你获得法律援助以后，我们会非常愿意开始为你提供帮助。)

18. 好的，谢谢您抽出宝贵的时间见我。一旦我收到法律援助中心的回复，我就会联系您的。
(Okay. Thank you for your valuable time. I'll contact you once I hear from Legal Aid.)
