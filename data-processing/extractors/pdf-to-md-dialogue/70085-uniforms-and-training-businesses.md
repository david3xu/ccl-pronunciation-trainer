# 70085. Uniforms and Training - Businesses

**Briefing:** The following dialogue takes place between Glenn, a training officer of a factory and a new employee. Glen is briefing the employee about a training program of the factory. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, welcome to your first day here. I'm Glenn, the training officer of the factory.
(你好。这是你入职的第一天，欢迎。我是格伦，工厂的培训师。)

2. 你好，格伦，我很高兴来到这。我希望我今天就能开始工作。
(Hello, Glenn. I'm glad to be here. I hope I can start today.)

3. Great. The first thing you need to do is to get your uniform from the uniform department. You should get five uniforms as a start.
(很好。首先你需要先去制服部门领制服。你先拿五套。)

4. 我需要买制服吗？我不知道这个是怎么操作的。我之前工作的地方从来没有穿过制服。
(Do I need to buy the uniforms? I don't know how this works. My previous workplace never required this.)

5. No, you don't need to buy your uniforms. It's provided by the factory. The uniform department will replace your uniforms if they are worn out or damaged.
(不，你不用付钱。制服是工厂提供的。如果制服磨损或者损坏了，制服部门都会给换的。)

6. 好的。我记住了。在面试的时候，经理说我要进行一个培训。我什么时候能开始呢？
(Okay, I'll keep that in mid. When I was having the interview, the manager said that there would be a training. When will it start?)

7. As soon as you put on your new uniform. I will be your training supervisor while you're learning.
(你换好制服以后就可以开始了。在你培训期间，我会是你的培训监督师。)

8. 我很高兴您是我的培训师。我希望我不用在一天内把工作全学完。我想我需要更多的时间。
(I'm glad that you are my training supervisor. I hope that I don't have to learn everything within a day. I think I need more time.)

9. We don't expect you to learn everything within 1 day. The training program will last for two weeks. I think there's enough time for you to settle in.
(我们没有要你一天就学会所有的内容。培训项目会持续两周。我想你是有足够的时间适应的。)

10. 谢谢。两周的话我就放心多了。我会尽快学习，努力工作。我希望我能把工作做好。
(Thanks. That's a huge relief if it lasts (for) 2 weeks. I'll try to be a quick learner and work hard. I hope I can do a good job.)

11. We like enthusiastic employees. I'm pretty sure you can do well. I'll be supervising you until you are ready to work on your own. The most important thing to learn is safety.
(我们也很喜欢有热情的员工呢。我相信你一定能做好的。直到你准备好可以独立工作之前，我都会一直带着你的。你要学的最重要的一件事就是注意安全。)

12. 我明白了。我会特别注意安全的。如果您准备好了，我们就开始吧。
(I see. I'll pay great attention to safety. Let's start whenever you're ready.)
