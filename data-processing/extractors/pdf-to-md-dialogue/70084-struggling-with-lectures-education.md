# 70084. Struggling with lectures - Education

**Briefing:** The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking University student who is struggling with her lectures and an English-speaking lecturer. The student is meeting the lecturer to ask for help. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning！ Come in and have a seat. How can I help you today?
(早上好。请进来坐吧。今天我能怎么帮到你呢？)

2. 你好。我很担心我现在在学的社会工作这门课。我无法完成我的作业。因为我上课的时候很难听懂。
(Hello. I'm quite worried about this social work course I'm studying. I can't complete my homework because it's very difficult for me to understand the class.)

3. I'm glad you asked for help. I'm sure we can find a solution. Why do you feel it's difficult to understand?
(我很高兴你来寻求帮助了。我们一定能想办法解决的。你为什么觉得很难听懂呢？)

4. 英语是我的第二语言。大多数时候，我能听懂您讲的话。但是您说的快的时候，我就会漏掉一些词。
(English is my second language. I can understand you most of the time. But I tend to miss some words when you are speaking too fast.)

5. I see. Sorry I SPEAK too fast. I'll try to slow down in the lecture. This may help you TO keep up.
(原来是这样。抱歉我讲得有些快了。我会试着在课上讲慢一些的，这样可能可以帮你跟上课程。)

6. 好的。当您讲新课题的时候，对我来说也很难。因为我不太熟悉您使用的语言。
(Okay. It's also difficult for me when you're talking about a new topic, because I'm not quite familiar with the language you used.)

**【萤火虫老师 Tips】**
Language 在表示"专门用语"这个意思的时候，不可数。

7. I can email you my notes before the lecture. In this way, you can make sure that you have time to understand the language and content ahead of the lecture. Feel free to ask me any questions if you need to.
(我可以在课前把我的笔记用邮件的形式发给你。这样的话，你可以确保在课前有时间去提前了解一下里面的用语和内容。如果你需要的话，有问题也尽管问我。)

8. 太好了， 谢谢。如果我不用担心上课能不能跟上的问题，我就能更专注于课程的内容了。
(That's great. Thank you. I can focus more on the lecture if I don't have to worry about whether or not I can keep up with it.)

**【萤火虫老师 Tips】**
If you keep up with something, you manage to do or understand all of it, or to do or understand it as well as other people.

9. You can also record the lecture. In this way, you can have the notes as well as the recording. You can also record the class discussion and any questions your classmates come up with.
(你也可以把课程录下来。这样的话，你又有笔记，又有录下来的课程。你还可以把课堂讨论和任何你同学们提出的问题都录下来。)

10. 这是个好主意。我可以在上课前看笔记，上课的时候把课程录下来，课后再去听。这样的话，我就不会错过重要的内容了。
(This is a good idea. I can read the notes in advance, record the lecture when I'm having it and listen to the recording afterwards. In this way, I won't miss anything important.)

11. You might also find it helpful to join the class discussion group in the library every Wednesday. I'll email you the details.
(每周三在图书馆有课程讨论小组，你可能也会觉得有帮助的。我把详细信息也发邮件给你。)

**【萤火虫老师 Tips】**
这里也有同学回忆的是 Wednesday noon, 多了一个中午。如果考到这个对话，这里要仔细听。

12. 噢！我还不知道有这个学习小组呢。我一定会参加的。谢谢您所有的建议。我之前还很担心我完成不了这门课呢。
(Oh! I didn't know about this study group. I'll definitely be there. Thank you for all your advice. I was quite worried that I might not be able to complete this course.)
