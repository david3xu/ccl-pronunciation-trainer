# 70064. Buying Home Insurance - Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place over the phone between Brian, an insurance salesperson and a mandarin-speaking client who wants to buy insurance for her new house. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, this is Brian. What can I do for you?  
(你好。我是布莱恩。我可以为您做些什么呢？)

2. 你好，我想给我的新房子买个保险。  
(Hello. I'd like to buy insurance for my new house.)

Insurance 不可数  
买保险：take out/buy insurance

3. I'm more than happy to help you with that. We have a wide range of insurance for you to choose from. You may take out insurance to cover your home, your belongings or both of them.  
(我很乐意帮助您。我们的保险多种多样，您可以随意选择。您可以给您的房子投保，给您的东西投保，或者都投保。)

Belongings: the things that a person owns, especially those that can be carried 所有物；行李

4. 我两样都想买。一旦出事了， 花我自己的钱去换东西和修房子，太不划算了。  
(I'd like to cover both of them. If anything happens, it's really not worth it to replace my stuff or repair the house out of my own pocket.)

5. Well, many people buy insurance for that reason. In your case, I recommend Home and Contents Insurance. It covers a range of events, such as fire, theft and attempted theft. It offers repair or replacement of your damaged property as well as the contents inside it.  
(嗯，很多人也是因为这个原因买保险。根据您的情况，我推荐住宅和住宅内物品保险。这个保险可以报销很多事故，比如说火灾，盗窃，盗窃未遂。对于您受损的房屋和房屋内的物品，它可以提供维修或置换。)

CCL 重点难词：attempted theft 盗窃未遂  
Attempted murder：谋杀未遂

6. 好的。这个保险适合我。我的孩子还小，我也担心他们踢球会把窗户玻璃踢碎了。  
(Okay. This insurance suits me well. My kids are still young, and I do have a concern that they may break the window when they're playing football.)

7. Well, you never know what will happen next. What else do you need to cover? For example, do you have any other important belongings?  
(嗯，世事难料嘛。您还有什么别的想投保的吗？比如说，您还有什么其他重要的东西吗？)

8. 我还有一台很贵的相机。我可没钱再买第二台了。我以后想成为一名专业的摄影师，开一个自己的工作室。  
(I have a very expensive camera and I don't think I can afford a second one. I want to become a professional photographer in the future with my own studio.)

9. In that case, you may choose our specific insurance, which is a type of property insurance in which only one individual property is covered by the policy. This insurance is tailored to protect your special item.  
(这样的话，您可以选择我们的特定保险/单独保险。这种财产保险的保单里只会保一样个人财产。这个保险是为保护您的特殊物品量身定制的。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Property insurance：财产保险 (这里 Property 就不是房产了哟)  
Policy：保险单；保单。(这里千万别翻政策)

10. 好的。我想问问，这个保险每个月要交多少钱呢？我希望有足够的保险额，但是我又不用交太高的保险金。  
(Okay. I'd like to know how much premium I should pay every month for this insurance. I hope the payout/ the amount insured is enough while the premium is acceptable.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
I'd like to know…宾语从句后面记得使用陈述句语序  
CCL 必考重点词：premium 保险费  
CCL 必考重点词：amount insured 保险金额/投保金额/保额

11. It depends on your level of cover. You'll get a quote by simply listing the items you want to cover and checking which option suits you most on the website.  
(这个是根据您的保险等级来定的。您可以把想投保的都列出来，在网上查查哪种最适合您，然后您就能知道报价了。)

12. 我今天回去就列单子。 如果我还有问题的话，再打电话给你。谢谢你的帮助。  
(I'll make the list after I'm back today. I'll give you another call if I have any other questions. Thank you for your help.)
