#70218. Van Theft Report and Insurance Steps - Legal

1.
Hi there, you've reached the non-urgent police assistance line. Constable Brown speaking. How can I help you today?
你好，这里是非紧急警务服务热线。我是布朗警员。今天我有什么能帮忙的吗？

2.
布朗警官，你好。我想报告一个情况，不确定算不算案件。但是我非常着急。
Hello Officer Brown, I want to report something. I'm not sure if it counts as a case. But I'm really worried about it.

3.
You've got the right line for non-emergency reports. If it's urgent, you'll need to hang up and dial 000.
您拨打的是非紧急报案电话。如果是紧急情况，你需要挂掉电话，然后拨打000。

4.
不是紧急的，就是我的面包车被偷了。是在我昨天工作的地方被偷的。不过我人没事。
It's not an emergency, it's just that my van was stolen. It was stolen from where I was working yesterday. But I'm physically fine.

5.
Discovering something stolen is always upsetting. Even non-urgent matters can be serious. Let's go over what happened so I can assist you.
发现东西被偷总是让人心烦。就算不算紧急，也可以是很严重的。我们过一下事情经过吧，我好帮你处理。

6.
主要是，这车是我干活用的，丢了很麻烦。保险公司让我先搞个报案单，然后才能申请赔付。
The main thing is that it's my work vehicle, losing it is a real headache. The insurance company wants me to get a police report first, then I can file a claim.

7.
Understood, work vehicles are crucial. So, a van was taken? Sounds like you need a theft report for the insurer. Tell me where and when you last saw it.
明白了，工作车辆很重要。那么，被偷的是一辆面包车？听起来你需要给保险公司提供一份盗窃报案单。告诉我你最后见到它的地点和时间。

8.
昨天上午，我在建筑工地干活。大概中午那会儿，发现我的面包车给人偷了。
Yesterday morning, while I was working at the construction site, around noon, I realized my van was stolen.

9.
Oh no, that's terrible! Vans are common targets for thieves. Whether the vehicle is locked or not, they know how to break in quickly.
哎呀，这太糟了！面包车是小偷的常见目标。不管车子有没有锁，他们都知道怎么快速弄开。

10.
车我锁好了，但没安防盗报警。要是有报警器，可能就把贼吓跑了。
I locked it up, but there was no anti-theft alarm. If there had been an alarm, it might have scared the thief off.

11.
Getting an alarm is definitely smart. But those pros can work so fast that sometimes an alarm doesn't even slow them down.
装报警器当然很明智。但那些专业小偷的动作太快，以至于有时候报警器甚至都拦不住他们。

12.
这件事就能显出保险的价值了。就算我的面包车最终找不回来，至少我还能拿到赔偿金。
This shows the value of insurance. Even if my van can't be recovered in the end, I can at least get the payout.

13.
Please tell me a few more details, like the location, time, any witnesses, and I'll give you a report reference number for your insurer.
请多告诉我几个细节，比如地点、时间、有无目击者，然后我会给您一个报案编号，您可以提供给保险公司。

14.
感谢你。一拿到报案号，我就马上联系保险公司。这个面包车可是我的血汗钱买的啊！
Thank you. As soon as I get the case number, I'll contact the insurance company right away. That van was bought with my hard-earned money!
