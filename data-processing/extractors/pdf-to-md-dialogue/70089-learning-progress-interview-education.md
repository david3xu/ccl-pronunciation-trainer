# 70089. Learning Progress Interview - Education

**Briefing:** This dialogue takes place between a mandarin-speaking parent and Anna, an English-speaking teacher. They are having a student progress meeting at school.

1. Good evening, my name is Anna. Won't you come in? I'm glad to meet you.
(晚上好，我是安娜。您请进吧！很高兴见到你。)

2. 谢谢你安娜。这是我第一次参加学生进度会议。我不太清楚要做些什么。
(Thank you Anna. It's my first time ever attending a student progress meeting. I'm not quite sure what to do.)

3. This is just a short meeting to discuss about how well your daughter is performing at school. You may also ask me some questions if you like.
(这就是开个小会，讨论一下您女儿在学校的表现如何。如果您有问题，也可以问我。)

4. 我明白了。我女儿跟我说她很喜欢上学，还交了朋友。我希望她有努力学习。
(I see. My daughter told me that she's keen to go to school and she's also made some friends. I hope she's been studying hard.)

5. She is. She is a quick learner, especially considering that she has just come to the school.
(有的。她学得很快，尤其是她才刚来这个学校。)

6. 听您这么说我很高兴。我一直担心她的英语不够好。
(I'm glad to hear that. I always worry that her English may not be good enough.)

7. She could benefit from practicing spelling, but it's not a big problem. She can keep up in all her subjects.
(她可以练练拼写，会对她有帮助的。不过问题不大。所有的科目她都能跟得上。)

8. 我能做些什么来帮助她提高拼写能力呢？我们每天晚上都会一起读书，但是我们没有做拼写练习。
(Is there anything I can do to help her improve that? We read together every evening, but we never did any spelling practice.)

9. I can give you some extra worksheets. You may start by helping her complete one of them every evening. She'll improve soon if you do so.
(我可以多给您几页练习题。您可以先每天晚上帮她完成一个。这样她会进步很快的。)

10. 谢谢您。我会保证她做完练习再去做美术的。她特别喜欢素描和绘画。
(Thank you. I'll make sure that she finishes the practice before making fine art. She's fond of sketching and drawing.)

11. She is indeed talented. I think it will be a great idea if she attends an art class. I'll give you the phone number of a teacher.
(她确实很有天赋。我想如果她去学美术课会很棒的。我把老师的电话给你吧。)

12. 好的，谢谢您。她一直都想参加美术课。还有什么是我需要知道的吗？
(Okay, thank you. She's always keen to attend an art class. Anything else I should know?)

13. No. She has been pleasant in class. If you do have any questions during the term, here's my school email address.
(没有啦。她在课上一直表现都很好。如果您这学期还有什么问题，可以联系我这个学校邮箱。)

14. 太好了。如果我想到什么问题的话，我就给您发邮件。很高兴见到您安娜。再见。
(That's great. I'll email you if I have any further questions. It's great to see you, Anna. Bye.)
