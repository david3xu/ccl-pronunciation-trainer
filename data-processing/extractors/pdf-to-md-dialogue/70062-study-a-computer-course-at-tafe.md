Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking course coordinator from a Technical and Further Education institute, and a mandarin-speaking potential student, who wants to make an enquiry about the courses. The dialogue begins now.

1. Good morning! This is Mark from Waverley Technical and Further Education. How can I help you today?  
(早上好！我是韦弗利技术和继续教育学院的马克，今天有什么可以帮您的呢？)

2. 你好，我想要了解一下办公室软件的课程。还有，我对电脑课程也很感兴趣。请问，我要怎么申请呀？  
(Hello! I'd like to know about Office software courses and I'm also interested in computer courses. How should I apply, if I may ask?)

3. Oh, I'm more than happy to help you with that! We have a wide range of computer literacy and Office software courses. All information regarding the courses is on our website.  
(噢，这个我很乐意帮您解答！我们有多种多样的电脑使用课程和办公室软件课程，相关信息都在我们网站上啦。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Computer literacy：具备使用电脑的能力  
补充高频词：Literacy and Numeracy: 读写和算术

4. 好的。我没有看过你们的网站。不过我家里有电脑，我回家以后会去看看哪个课程最适合我的。请问，课程的学费是多少呢？  
(Okay. I haven't seen your website yet. I do have a computer at home though, I'll see which course suits me when I'm back. What about the tuition fee of these courses, if I may ask?)

5. The tuition fees are also listed with the course information. We have certificate courses, diploma courses and short courses. They are all very popular.  
(课程的学费也跟课程信息列在一起啦。我们有证书课程，文凭课程和短期课程。这些课程都很受欢迎呢。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Certificate 证书(课程)/认证(课程)/证明  
Diploma 文凭(课程)  
Degree 学位(课程)

6. 这些课程听上去很复杂呀！您觉得哪种课程适合我这样的新手呢？  
(They sound quite complicated. Which one do you think is suitable for a beginner like me?)

7. Well, you may start with the short courses as an introduction for the subject. Here's a brochure with all the information.  
(嗯，您可以从短期课程学起，来做个初步了解。所有信息都在这个小册子里啦。)

8. 那…我先从短期课程开始吧！等我有了初步了解以后，再选认证课程，或者文凭课程吧！我想先从简单的开始。  
(Well…then I'll start with the short course. I'll decide between certificate courses and diploma courses after I've got a general understanding /after I understand the basics. I'd like to start with an easy one.)

9. That's a smart choice. Please fill in the application form and bring it back to us later. As for the tuition fee, we accept payment by installments.  
(您这个选的很聪明。请您填一下申请表，之后交给我们吧。关于学费，我们可以接受分期付款。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
分期付款：pay for something by/in installments  
刷卡支付：pay by card  
现金支付：pay in cash (不要说 by cash)

10. 好的，谢谢您。我把申请表拿回去研究一下。如果我对这个表格有什么问题，我可以回来问你吗？  
(Okay, thank you. I'll take it home to do some research. May I come back and ask you if I have some questions about it?)

11. Of course! All the application forms are here, and we always have staff at the front desk to answer all your questions.  
(当然啦！所有的申请表都在这了。我们前台随时有人，可以回答您的各种问题。)

12. 好的，太感谢你了！我会先在你们网上查一下的。如果之后我还是不确定，我会回来找你们的。再见！  
(Okay, thank you so much! I'll browse your website first. If I'm still confused, I'll be back. See you!)
