#70035. Visitation Right Dispute Mediation - Legal

1.
Hello. I'm John Smith. I'll be the mediator in this mediation.
你好，我是约翰史密斯。我是这次调解会的调解员。

2.
你好，很高兴见到你。
Hello. Nice to meet you.

3.
Please bear in mind that this is a 2-hour long session, it's confidential and it's aimed to solve the issues concerning your son's visitation rights. Your husband is not here upon your request.
请记住，这是个会议时长为两小时，内容保密，旨在解决你儿子探视权的问题。根据你的要求，你丈夫不会在场。

4.
我太害怕他了。他一直威胁我，还折磨我的孩子。
I'm so afraid of him. He keeps threatening me and he also tortured my child.

5.
Okay. I'll note it down. I can understand why you don't want to have this conversation with your husband in one room. Could you be more specific?
好的。我会记下来的。我可以理解你为什么不想跟你丈夫共处一室进行这个会谈。你可以再具体说说吗？

6.
他这人太不可信了。上周本来应该是我去接孩子，结果他去接了，他还说孩子在学校的行为有问题。
He's very untrustworthy. I should have picked up my child last week, yet he did it. He also said my child had behavior problems at school.

7.
I'm sorry, but I have to say that you're undermining your visitation right as you didn't pick up your son on the designated date as discussed.
我很抱歉，但是我不得不说，因为你没有按照讨论好的指定日期去接孩子，你正在削弱你的探视权。

8.
我养了孩子 13 年啊！13 年！结果换来了什么？过去 3 个月我都没见到他啊！我丈夫太没良心了！
I have raised my child for 13 years! 13 years! What did I get in exchange? I haven't seen him for the past 3 months! My husband has no conscience at all!

9.
Please control your emotions and listen carefully. Being emotional won't solve any problems. You need to make sure you can pick up your child on your next visitation date.
请您控制下您的情绪，仔细听好。情绪化不能解决任何问题。你需要确保下次探视时间你可以去接孩子。

10.
他的律师威胁我说，我这辈子都别想见到孩子了！他真是个没心没肺的东西！
His lawyer threatened me that I could never see my child for the rest of my life! He is really heartless!

11.
Please control your emotions and listen carefully. You need to understand your right that according to the court order, you can pick up your son every fortnight. So, you can forget what his lawyer said.
请你控制下您的情绪，仔细听好。你需要明白你的权利，根据法院法令，每过两周你可以去接一次儿子。所以不要管他的律师怎么说。

12.
你能建议我再做些什么吗？你得让他的律师停止威胁我。我最近简直是白天也坐立不安，晚上也睡不好啊！
What else would you suggest doing? You need to ask his lawyer to stop threatening me. I've been on pins and needles recently during the day and I can't sleep well in the night!

13.
I'm afraid I can't, as I only wear one hat, which is your mediator. Good luck.
我恐怕不能这么做, 因为我的身份/职责只能有一个，就是你的调解员。祝你好运。

14.
怎么能这样！他这个没心没肺的东西，和他的律师一起就这么一直欺负我吗！
How come! He is heartless! He's just been walking all over me with his lawyer!

15.
I understand that you are distressed, but accusation won't be helpful. You need to abide by the agreement. You were so distressed that you forgot to pick up your son. If you continue like this, you may lose your visitation right.
我可以理解你的痛苦。但是光指责是帮不了你的/没用的。你需要遵守协议。你之前太心烦了，都忘了接儿子了。如果你继续这样下去，你可能会失去探视权。

16.
好的，谢谢，下周五我就去接儿子，周一把他送回去。
Okay. Thanks. I'll pick up my son next Friday and send him back on Monday.
