Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking tourist and an English-speaking clerk in a hotel lobby. The tourist would like to book a room for five nights. The dialogue starts now.

1. How are you? Welcome to our hotel! Do you have a reservation?
(您好吗？欢迎您！您有预定吗？)

补充：您有空房吗： Do you have a vacant room?

54. 您好。我没有预定，但我想订五个晚上。您这边有什么样的房间呢？
(Hello. I don't have a reservation. But I would like to book for five nights. What types of rooms have you got?)

55. We have a wide range of rooms with different views to suit all your needs. What's your budget?
(我们的房间各式各样，能看到的风景也各不相同，可以满足您的各种需求。您的预算是多少呢？)

56. 我想要一个海景房，毕竟你们酒店在海滩旁边嘛。房间要可以住两个大人，房间最好有一个阳台。我的预算是每晚 150 澳币, 最多每晚 180 澳币。
(I want a room with an ocean view. After all, your hotel is by the beach. I want the room for two adults, and preferably with a balcony. My budget is 150 to 180 dollars per night at most.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
海景房：a room with an ocean view;
豪华套房：a luxury suite;
A family room: 家庭房

57. We have a north-facing, one-bedroom apartment with an amazing city view. That one costs $160 per night.
(我们有一个朝北的公寓式房间，有一个卧室，可以看到很棒的城市风景。价格是每晚 160 澳币。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
夜景：night views

58. 你们有靠海的房间吗？你们酒店靠海，我们想要海景房。我就是喜欢看海。
(Do you have any rooms close to the sea? Your hotel is by the sea and we want a room with an ocean view. I just love seeing the sea.)

59. We also have a one-bedroom apartment with a view of the sea. That room comes with a fully functional kitchen and a balcony, but that one costs $190 per night.
(我们有一个公寓式房间，有一个卧室，有非常美的海景。房间带有全功能厨房和阳台，但是价格是每晚 190 澳币。)

60. 那好吧。虽然超过了预算，但我还是住这个吧。 毕竟我们就是为了看海才来的。
(That's fine. I'll take that although it's beyond our budget. After all, that's what we came here for.)

61. Great. Then I'll book this room on the 34th floor for you. The total cost will be $950 for five nights. How would you like to pay?
(太好了。那我就为您订 34 层的这间房了。五个晚上一共是 950 澳币。您想怎么付款呢？)

62. 我刷信用卡吧。请问酒店附近有什么景点和餐厅推荐吗？
(I'll pay through credit card. Do you have any recommendations for tourist attractions and restaurants near the hotel/within the vicinity, if I may ask?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
必去/必看的地方：a "must see/go" place
Within the vicinity: the area around a particular place 附近

11. The beach is very popular. You will find a booklet in the room with lots of information about key attractions and restaurants. Okay, it's all booked. I also need a copy of your ID.
(我们的海滩是很受欢迎的。您房间的小册子里有很多主要景点和餐厅的信息。好了，都订好了。我还需要您身份证件的副本。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
澳大利亚不像中国，有身份证，所以像护照，驾照这类可以证明身份的，都算 ID，所以不建议翻身份证，可以说身份证件。
另外如果是 a copy，是副本/副件，可以是电子的也可以是纸质的；a photocopy 才翻复印件。

63. 这是我的护照，您尽管拿去复印吧。
(Here's my passport. Feel free to photocopy it.)

64. Here's your key. I hope you enjoy your stay here.
(这是您的钥匙。希望您在这住的愉快。)

65. 谢谢您，我特别想去这边的海滩。我肯定会很享受这边的时光的。你们酒店真好。
(Thank you. I'm keen to visit the beach here. I'll definitely enjoy my time here! This is such a lovely hotel.)
