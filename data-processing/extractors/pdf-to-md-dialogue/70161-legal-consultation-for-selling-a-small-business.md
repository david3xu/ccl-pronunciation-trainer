#70161. Legal Consultation for Selling a Small Business - Legal

1.
Good morning. Thanks for your call. How can I help you?
早上好。感谢您的来电。我能怎么帮助您？

2.
早上好。我需要咨询一些法律建议。我看到你们的网站上说，你们专门针对小生意提供法律建议。
Good morning. I need some legal advice. I saw on your website that you specialize in providing legal advice for small businesses.

3.
Yes, that's correct. We provide business owners with advice on commercial and employment matters. Why do you need legal advice?
是的，没错。我们给商家提供商业和雇佣方面的法律建议。您为什么需要法律建议呢？

4.
事情是这样的：我有一个小生意和三个雇员，但我现在想要卖掉这个生意。这是一个很艰难的决定。
Here is the thing: I have a small business with three employees, but I want to sell the business now. It's a tough decision.

5.
I see. I can help you with the legal aspects of selling your business, if you like. However, you will need to handle the arrangements for the employees yourself.
我明白了。如果您愿意，我可以帮助您处理出售生意的法律事务。然而，您需要自己处理员工的安排。

6.
谢谢。我需要您帮我起草卖生意的协议。我已经找到买家了，但我的组织能力不是很好。
Thank you. I need your help to draft the sales agreement. I have already found a buyer, but my organizational skills are not very strong.

7.
Congratulations! I can help you draft the agreement. That won't be a problem. When you need to terminate the employment contracts, I can help with that as well.
恭喜！我可以帮助您起草合同。没问题的。您需要终止员工合同的时候，我也可以帮忙。

8.
不，员工希望继续为新买家工作。买家已经同意了，我也希望他们都能有个好去处。
No, the employees want to continue working for the new buyer. The buyer has agreed, and I hope they all find a good place.

9.
That would be a good outcome for all of you. I will prepare a conditional sales agreement, which will also provide legal protection for the employees.
那对你们所有人来说都会是一个很好的结果。我会起草一份附带条件的出售协议，让员工也能获得法律保护。

10.
谢谢你，这样我就放心多了。我不喜欢因为遗漏一些部分，而导致预想不到的事情发生。
Thank you. This makes me feel much more relieved. I don't like it when unexpected things happen because of missing some parts.

11.
Yes, it's always a wise decision to seek help from professionals, as drafting a sales agreement involves many considerations.
是的，寻求专业人士的帮助总是明智的决定，因为起草出售协议涉及许多需要考虑的事项。

12.
是的，我还有很多存货和设备，也需要包含在卖生意的协议里。
Yes, I also have a lot of inventory and equipment that need to be included in the sales agreement.

13.
Why don't we schedule an appointment to organize the sales agreement? If it's urgent, I'm available at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
我们约个时间来整理出售协议怎么样？如果事情紧急的话，我明天下午两点有空。

14.
太好了！明天见，期待见到您以及开始弄协议。
Great! See you tomorrow. I look forward to meeting you and getting started on the agreement.
