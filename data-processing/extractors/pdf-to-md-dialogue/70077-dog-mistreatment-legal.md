#70077. Dog Mistreatment - Legal

1.
Thank you for calling the Animal Protection Society. Henry speaking. What can I do for you today?
感谢致电动物保护协会。我是亨利。我今天能为您做些什么呢？

2.
你好。我有个事儿一直很烦，但是又不知道该怎么做。怎么说呢…我觉得我的邻居一直在虐待他家的狗。
Hello. Something is bothering me, but I don't quite know what to do. How do I put this…I think my neighbor has been abusing his dog.

3.
Well, first I have to say that I'm glad you made this call. Could you tell me more details? Why do you think the dog has been mistreated?
嗯，首先，我很高兴您给我们打电话了。您能再多提供一些细节嘛？为什么您觉得那只狗被虐待了呢？

4.
一开始的时候呢，我总听见狗叫。那时候我以为是狗不听话，就也没放在心上。但是后来有一次，我走到我邻居家栅栏边上，看到他家后院连狗的水碗都没有。狗每天一定渴坏了啊！
At first, I always heard the dog barking. At that time, I thought the dog was being disobedient, so I didn't take it seriously. But then there was one time when I approached my neighbor's fence and saw that there wasn't even a water bowl for the dog in the backyard. The dog must be very thirsty every day!

5.
Well, that's not a good thing. Actually, dogs need to have drinks available at all times. Apart from this, have you noticed any other bad things?
嗯，那可不太好。实际上，狗狗是需要随时有水喝的。除了这个，你还注意到其他别的不好的事儿吗？

6.
让我想想…有的。那只狗很大，但是特别瘦。我都能看见它的肋骨了。它的毛都发黄了，还打结，一点光泽都没有。我感觉它的状态特别差。
Let me see…yes, the dog is large but skinny. I can see its ribs. Its hair has got yellowed and tangled. Its coat is very dull. I can feel it's in a terrible condition.

7.
That's terrible. You shouldn't have been able to see its ribs. From what you have told me, it seems that the dog is not in a good condition. I think you might be right: the dog is being tortured.
这实在太差了。你本不该能看见肋骨的。根据你给我讲的这些，似乎狗的情况很不好。我觉得你说得没错：这只狗正在遭受折磨。

8.
是啊，我的邻居从来不遛狗。其实我想过，去敲他家门，跟他聊聊狗的事儿。但是我又怕我邻居不高兴，就打电话给你们了。
Yes. My neighbor never walks his dog. I have actually planned to knock on his door and talk with him about the dog. But I'm concerned that he might be upset. So I gave you this call instead.

9.
Well, to avoid any unnecessary trouble, it's better not to approach your neighbor by yourself. Anyway, I'll write a report on this abuse case and we'll send a protection officer to visit him.
嗯，为了避免不必要的麻烦，你最好不要自己去找你邻居。总之呢，我会就这次虐狗事件写一个报告的，我们也会派保护专员去你邻居家。

10.
好的。其实吧，我不想给我邻居惹麻烦。但是那只狗的情况实在太让人担心了。
Okay. In fact, I'm not trying to get him into trouble. But the dog's condition is just so worrying.

11.
Actually, you don't have to worry too much about it. If the dog hasn't been mistreated, then your neighbor won't get into trouble. The protection officer will simply provide him with some information about how to take good care of a dog.
其实，你不用太担心这个。如果狗没有受到虐待，你邻居是不会惹上麻烦的。保护专员只会给他提供一些怎么好好照顾狗的信息。

12.
那还行。我希望保护专员赶快去他们家。我很高兴给你们打电话了。希望我能帮到那只狗。
That's good. I hope the protection officer will visit him soon. I'm glad that I called. Hope I can help the dog.

13.
Don't worry. The officer will visit your neighbor in the next couple of days. If anything gets worse or feels wrong, feel free to give us a call.
别担心，保护专员接下来几天就会去你邻居家。如果情况有变更差，或者有觉得不对劲的地方，请尽管给我们打电话。

14.
我一定会的。真希望那只狗赶快好起来。谢谢您接听我的电话。
I'll definitely do. I really hope that dog can get well soon. Thank you for taking my call.
