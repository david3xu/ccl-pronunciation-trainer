#70232. Ceiling Leak Emergency Report - Business

1.
Good afternoon, this is your property manager Steven. I'm returning your call about an apartment issue. How can I help?
下午好，我是你的物业经理史蒂文。您来电反映公寓问题，我给您回电。有什么可以帮您？

2.
你好！感谢这么快回电。我是新租客。我的主卧天花板在漏水！
Hi! Thanks for calling back so soon. I'm a new tenant. My master bedroom ceiling is leaking!

3.
Welcome to the building. For repair requests, our online platform ensures faster processing, and we can also have a written record.
欢迎入住。维修请求通过在线平台处理更快，我们还能有书面记录。

4.
这次我等不及系统处理了。暴雨后，漏水越来越严重，墙皮都开始脱落了！
This can't wait. The leak got worse after the storm, and the wall paint is peeling now!

5.
Our online system prioritizes urgent cases too. Notifications will come to me straight away. Could you describe the leak location?
我们的线上系统也会优先处理紧急情况的。通知会直接发到我这边的。请描述漏水位置?

6.
就在床的正上方！就现在，水滴都直接往被子上滴呢。昨晚简直像睡在水帘洞里。
Right above the bed! Water is now dripping directly onto the quilt. It felt like I was sleeping under a waterfall last night.

7.
That's certainly unacceptable. It must have been disturbing to you. Has there been any roof renovation work done recently?
这确实不能忍。一定让你很烦吧。最近楼顶有施工吗？

8.
不知道。我才搬来五天。这漏水痕迹，明显是陈旧的水渍，都是发黄的。
I don't know. I just moved in five days ago. The water stains are clearly old and yellowed.

9.
You're right. Water damage can compromise structural safety. I'll dispatch roofers immediately.
您说得对。漏水可能危害结构安全。我马上派屋顶维修工。

10.
太好了，救了我的命。希望他们不用拆天花板。我才刚刚布置好卧室啊。
Great! That's a lifesaver. Hopefully they won't need to tear down the ceiling. I just finished decorating the bedroom.

11.
Apologies this wasn't detected during inspection. We'll try to minimize the damage and update you hourly.
很抱歉，查房时没发现这问题。我们会尽量把损坏降到最小，每小时跟你更新进展。

12.
谢谢。维修需要我清空衣帽间吗？我的衣服才刚刚按照颜色整理好啊。
Thanks. Should I empty the walk-in closet? I just sorted my clothes by colour.

13.
You just need to remove bedding temporarily. Protective covers will be used during repairs.
就暂时移开床上用品就行。施工时会铺防护罩的。

14.
好的。那我等你通知。希望快点修好，别再漏水了。谢谢你。下次再报修，我会在网上提交的。
Okay. I'll wait to hear from you. Hope the repair gets done soon and the leaking stops. Thanks. Next time I need to report a repair, I'll do it online.
