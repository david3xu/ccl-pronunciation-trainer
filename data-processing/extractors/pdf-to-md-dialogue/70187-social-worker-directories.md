#70187. Social Worker Directories - Social

1.
Good morning, it's nice to see you. How have you been recently?
早上好，很高兴见到你。最近怎么样？

2.
你好，我也很高兴能见到你。我最近因为要经常去看望我母亲，她身体不太好。所以我很累。
Hello, I'm also very glad to see you. Recently, I've been frequently visiting my mother because her health hasn't been good. That's why I'm really tired.

3.
I remember you once said that she has not been well recently. You must have spent several hours going back and forth to her house, right?
我记得你曾经说过她最近身体不太好。你肯定花了好几个小时来回跑她家，对吧？

4.
是的，要花很多时间。我每周都要去看她，还得工作，几乎没时间做其他事情。
Yes, it takes a lot of time. I have to visit her every week and also work, so I hardly have time to do anything else.

5.
That sounds very difficult. I heard that you might talk to a social worker. They could help you find services suitable for your mother so that visiting her won't be so tiring.
听起来真不容易。我听说你可以找社工聊聊。他们可能会帮你看看有没有适合你母亲的服务，这样探望她就不会那么辛苦了。

6.
好主意，我之前不知道还能找到这样的帮助。我该去哪儿找社工的联系方式呢？
Good idea, I didn't know I could find such help. Where can I get the contact information of a social worker?

7.
There are social worker associations. You can find their services online and on social media. You can also locate social workers near your mom's home. There are online directories available.
有一些社工协会。你可以在网上和社交媒体上找到他们的服务。你也可以找到离你母亲住处近的社工，还有在线名录可供查找。

8.
谢谢你。有了社工名录的帮助，事情会容易很多。要不然，我真不知道该从哪里开始。
Thank you. With the help of a social worker directory, things would be much easier. Otherwise, I really wouldn't know where to start.

9.
Yes. Since these are professional organizations, you can find their names listed in directories. Elder care is a sensitive matter, so it's important to find someone qualified.
是的。由于这些是专业机构，你可以在名录上查到他们的名字。养老问题很敏感，所以找到有资质的人很重要。

10.
感谢你的信息，真的很有帮助。我有很多问题想问他们。如果有人能帮我照顾我妈直到她好起来，我就放心了。
Thank you for the information; it's really helpful. I have many questions to ask them. If someone could take care of my mother until she gets better, I would feel at ease.

11.
It's always hard when parents get old and need help. It's harder when they don't live nearby.
父母年纪大了需要帮助总是很不容易的，他们不住在附近的话就更不容易了。

12.
我们一直想住得离她近点。在她生病之前，我们就开始看房和准备买房了。但她生病以后，看房计划就搁置了。
We always want to live closer to her. Before she got sick, we were already looking at houses and planning to buy one. But after she fell ill, our house-hunting plans were put on hold.

13.
That's unfortunate. I hope she recovers soon so you can resume your house hunt. There are many houses in this area.
真可惜。我希望她能快点康复，这样你就能继续找房子了。这一带有很多房子。

14.
是的，我希望我们能找到个好房子。这样我去看望母亲就方便多了。
Yes, I hope we can find a good place. That way, it will be much more convenient for me to visit my mother.
