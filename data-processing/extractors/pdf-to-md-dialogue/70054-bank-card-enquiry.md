# 70054. Bank card enquiry - Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking bank clerk and a mandarin speaking old lady, who would like to make an enquiry about a new card she has received. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning. How can I help you?
(早上好，我能如何帮到您呢？)

214. 早上好。我收到了一个邮寄来的银行卡，我不清楚这个卡是在自动取款机上用的呢, 还是在别的地方用的呢？
(Good morning. A band card was mailed to me and I'm not sure whether it's an ATM card or something else.)

215. Let me have a look. Oh, actually, it can be used with an ATM, but you can also use it when you are shopping. It is called the pay wave card.
(我看下。哦，其实这个卡可以在自动取款机上用的，但您购物时也能用。这个叫非接触式支付卡。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Paywave 是 Visa(维萨卡)的支付方式，这个固定翻译来自 Visa 中文官网。

216. 哦。我不喜欢欠钱。我从来没用过信用卡。如果我要买东西，我都是先把钱存起来的。
(Okay. I don't like the idea of owing someone money. I have never used a credit card before. I always save before buying something.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Owe 这个词的固定搭配：
Owe someone money;
Owe money to someone

217. When you use it to shop, it uses the money that's already in your account. It is different from a credit card.
(您用这张卡买东西时，卡里划掉的是已经在您账户里的钱。这个跟信用卡不一样的。)

218. 是吗？就像手机支付一样吗？我看见过别人用的。他们都不要收据的。
(Really? Just like paying by phone? I've seen others doing it. They don't need receipts.)

7. It's similar but much simpler. You. just need to tap the card on a small mechaine at the checkout counter.
(是有些像，但是比手机支付简单多了。您只需要在结账柜台那儿的一个小小的机器上，用卡轻轻碰一下就可以了。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Tap the card = touch/place the card 用卡轻触读卡机  Swipe the card: 刷卡(有从上到下在卡槽里刷卡的动作)
Insert the card：插卡

219. 哦，原来是这样。现在高科技发展的很快啊！
(Oh, I see. High technology is growing so fast now!)

220. Yes. New technology is amazing. New things are invented all the time.
(是的，新科技太棒了。总能有新发明。)

221. 对于像我这样的人来说, 太难了。我之前试着去本地的图书馆，学习怎么用电脑和网络，但是最终我放弃了。用这个卡的话，我不用输入密码或者签字吗？
(It's so difficult for people like me. I tried learning how to use a computer and the internet in a local library, but I gave up in the end. Does it mean that I don't have to enter my password or give my signature with this card?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
输入密码：enter the password
Try doing something: 尝试做某事(试一试，看看有没有效果)
Try to do something: 努力做某事(等于 try one's best to do something)

222. No, not if the total amount is under 100 dollars. If it's beyond that, you need to enter a. 4-digit password. But please remeber not to put the number on your card.
(不用的，低于 100 块的都不用。如果超过 100 块，您需要输入一个四位数的密码。不过您得记着，别把密码写到卡上。)

223. 不会的，我还没那么傻。但是万一卡被偷了怎么办呢？信用卡至少还需要签字，这个卡多容易被别人偷走盗用啊！
(I won't. I'm not that silly. But what if the card is stolen? A credit card at least requires a signature. It's quite easy for others to steal and use it!)

224. If the card is lost or stolen, you should contact us immediately so that we can cancel the card for you.
(如果卡丢了，或者被偷了，您要马上联系我们，这样我们就可以帮您取消这张卡。)

14. 好的，我会试试这个卡的。太感谢你的帮助了。
(Okay. I'll give it a go. Thank you so much for your help.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Give it a go/give it a try: 试一试
