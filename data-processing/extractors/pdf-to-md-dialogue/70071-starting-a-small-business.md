# 70071. Starting a small business – Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking financial adviser and a mandarin-speaking client. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello! I don't get to see you often except for during tax season. What can I do for you today?

(你好！除了报税季，我基本都见不着你。我今天能为你做些什么呢？)

2. 你好！我和我的朋友打算合开一个小公司，打算申请贷款。我们非常需要你的帮助。

(Hello. I plan to start a small business with my friend and we're going to apply for a loan. We could really use your help.)

3. Well, isn't this that exciting? May I ask how much you know about the loan? Do you have any relevant experience in the industry?

(这真的很让人激动啊。我可以问问你们对贷款了解多少吗？你们之前有什么行业相关经验吗？)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
May I ask 宾语从句后面加陈述句语序，比如 May I ask where the library is?
这段英翻中，后面补上一句，中文意思是：这可以增加你们成功贷款的几率。英文可以是：This will increase your chance of success/ You'll have a greater chance of success if that's the case.

4. 我和我的朋友在这个行业都已经工作很多年了，而且我们一直都想开自己的公司。对了，银行要求我们提供一份五年的商业计划书。

(We've worked in the industry for many years and we've always wanted to start our own business. By the way, the bank requires us to provide a five-year business plan.)

5. I'm glad to hear that. Well, there are some basics in a business plan, such as your product detail, your business's budget, expenses, sales forecast, estimated annual turnover and expected profit.

(很高兴听到这个消息。商业计划书里有一些基本的内容，比如你产品的细节信息，公司的预算，支出，销售预测，预计的年营业额和利润等等。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Turnover：the amount of business that a company does in a period of time (营业额/成交量)
例句1: Large supermarkets have high turnovers. (=their goods sell quickly 大超市的商品销量很高。)
例句2: The business has an annual turnover of 100,000 AUD. 这家公司的年营业额有10万澳币。

6. 这信息量有点大呀，我们真的需要你帮忙了。

(That's a lot of information. We could really use your help.)

7. Don't worry. We just need to go through the process step by step. There're also some tips to help you get loan approval as soon as possible.

(别担心，我们按照流程一步一步来就好了。有一些小秘诀也能帮你的贷款尽快批下来。)

8. 真的吗？你指哪些小秘诀呢？

(Really？What kind of tips do you mean?)

9. Well, for example, you may also include more details in your business plan, such as the location of your business, any similar businesses nearby and a summary of your previous experience in the industry. This will help boost your reliability.

(这个嘛，比如说，你还可以在你的商业计划书里面列举更多的细节信息，比如说你公司的位置，附近是否有其他类似的企业，以及你们之前的工作经验总结。这些会帮助提高你们的可信度。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Boost = increase, improves 改善；提高；增强；推动
例：I need to pass the test to boost my confidence. 我需要通过考试来增强自信心。

10. 原来如此，您真专业。我跟我朋友再商量一下, 我们之后肯定还有很多问题想问您。非常感谢您的帮助。

(I see. You are really professional. I'll have another discussion with my friend and we'll definitely have lots of questions to ask you. Thank you very much for your help.)

11. No worries. That's what I'm here for.

(不客气。这是我应该做的。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
That's what I'm here for = That's my job/role.
