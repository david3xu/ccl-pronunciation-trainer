#70166. Fundraising Event Planning - Social+Business

1.
Hi there! Come on in and have a seat, please! Sorry I was quite occupied yesterday, but I'm all set to discuss things with you now.
嗨！进来坐吧！抱歉我昨天太忙了，不过现在我准备好跟你讨论了。

2.
没关系的。我们可以讨论如何筹集资金，你有什么想法吗?
No problem! We can talk about how to raise funds. Do you have any ideas?

3.
This has been on my mind all week. I think it's a good idea to host an event. I believe some people might be keen to join it.
我这周一直在想这个。我觉得举办一个活动是个好主意。我相信有些人可能会很想参加。

4.
这个主意真不错。我一直在想，是否可以向本地的商家寻求捐赠，募集一些物品来进行销售。我还想动员他们，通过举办社区活动，筹集到更多的资金。
That's a great idea! I've been thinking about whether we could ask local businesses for donations to collect some items for sale. I also want to get them involved in organizing community events to raise more funds.

5.
That's a fantastic idea! I think reaching out to local stores is a great way to get the community involved. What kind of event do you think we should organize to make this happen?
这真是个好主意！我觉得联系本地商店是让社区参与的好办法。你觉得我们应该组织什么样的活动来实现这个目标呢？

6.
我觉得这次活动可以跟动物有关。你觉得跟本地的动物收容所合作怎么样？
I think this event could be animal-related. What do you think about cooperating with the local animal shelter?

7.
What do you think about organizing a native animal show? We can advertise locally, and I think it would be a hit with families. It would offer something fresh and different.
你觉得组织一个本地动物展怎么样？我们可以在本地宣传，我觉得家庭会很喜欢。这可以带来一些新鲜和不同的体验。

8.
听起来很棒呀！大家可以去动物收容所参观，看看被救助的猫和狗。参观完，还可以领养动物。
It sounds great! People can visit the animal shelter and see the rescued cats and dogs. After the visit, they can also adopt animals.

9.
Absolutely! We can raise more funds to benefit these animals. By encouraging people to adopt, we not only give these animals a new home but also reduce the strain on the shelter.
当然可以！我们可以筹集更多资金来帮助这些动物。通过鼓励人们领养，不仅能给这些动物一个新家，还能减轻收容所的压力。

10.
好的，这件事我可以做。我们需要找到一些志愿者，来帮我们组织这次活动。这样可以帮助我们降低预算和费用。
Sure, I can take care of this. We need to find some volunteers to help us organize the event. This way, we can help keep our budget and cost down.

11.
Yes, we'll need a group of volunteers to help plan the event details. Their support will be essential for organizing everything smoothly. By working together, we can keep our cost down and ensure the event is successful.
是的，我们需要一组志愿者来帮忙策划活动的细节。他们的帮助对顺利组织一切是非常重要的。通过合作，我们可以降低成本，确保活动成功。

12.
好的，听起来不错！那我们可以聊聊活动的具体安排，还有怎么协调我们的工作。
Great, that sounds good! Let's talk about the specific arrangements for the event and how we can coordinate our work.

13.
Sure! We also need to get the word out about the event and aim for as many people as possible to notice it. It's important to get a big crowd to join it.
没问题！我们还需要宣传这个活动，尽量让更多人注意到它。吸引大批人参与是很重要的。

14.
我同意你的看法。我们可以约定几天后再深入讨论一下活动的细节。我也会准备一些资料，发给你们。期待我们的合作！
I agree with you. We can schedule to discuss the details of the event further in a few days. I'll also prepare some materials and send them to you. I'm looking forward to working together!
