# 70072. Looking for a translation service – Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking agent and a mandarin-speaking client. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello. I'm Mark. How may I help you today?

(你好，我是马克。今天我能如何帮到您呢？)

2. 你好，我这几天刚到澳大利亚，我有一些比较重要的文件需要翻译。

(Hello. I've just arrived in Australia several days ago and I need to have some important documents translated.)

3. Unfortunately, we don't offer translation service, but I can find some translation companies for you. It will take a few minutes.

(很抱歉，我们这里并不提供翻译服务，但是我可以帮您找一找翻译公司的信息。请您稍等一会儿。)

4. 不着急。我下午没什么事，所以我有时间等。

(Take your time. I'm not busy this afternoon so I've got time.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Take your time: If you take your time doing something, you do it quite slowly and do not hurry.
例：Take your time. I'm in no hurry.

5. Here's a list of translation services. May I ask what kind of document you need to translate?

(这里列出了一些翻译服务的信息。请问您需要翻译什么类型的文件呢？)

6. 我正在申请大学，所以我需要翻译之前的学术文件，比如说成绩单等等。

(I'm applying to universities, so I need to have my previous academic documents translated, such as my transcripts.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Apply to + 要申请的单位：apply to the bank for a loan 向银行申请贷款
Apply for + 要申请的东西： apply for jobs/scholarships

7. That should be okay. Some translation services offer academic document translation.

(应该没问题，有些翻译服务是提供学术文件翻译的。)

8. 请问翻译这些需要花多少钱呢？我有很多文件需要翻译，但是我并没有带很多钱过来。

(May I ask how much it costs to translate these documents? I need to have many documents translated, but I don't have much money with me.)

9. Don't worry. It depends on what kind of services you choose and how many documents you are going to translate. Some services provide discounts. I'll write down their phone numbers for you.

(不用担心，这要看你选什么类型的翻译服务和你要翻译文件的数量。有些翻译服务还有折扣。我把他们的电话号码写给你。)

10. 谢谢你，我先打电话问问价格。对了，我还有我以前的工作记录和推荐信。如果我把这些也一起翻译了，会不会有用呢？

(Thank you. I'll give them a call first to get a quote. By the way, I also have my previous work record and reference letter here. Will it be helpful if I have them translated as well?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Have something done: 找某人做某事

11. I believe so. It will give you an edge in the job market. Having a part-time job can also help you cover your cost after being accepted into university.

(我觉得是有用的，这会让你找工作更有优势。在你被大学录取以后，有一份兼职工作也可以帮你支付生活开支。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Edge: 多义词。在这里表示 an advantage over other people: 优势
例：In terms of work experience, she definitely had the edge over the other people that we interviewed.

12. 如果能找到兼职工作就太好啦。非常感谢你。回头我有问题再联系您。

(It will be great if I can find a part-time job. Thank you very much. I'll ask for your help again if I have any further questions.)
