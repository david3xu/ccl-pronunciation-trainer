1. 您好，我今天有什么可以帮您的？  
(Hello. How can I help you today?)

2. 您好，我想给我十岁的儿子领养一只小狗。  
(Hello. I'd like to adopt a puppy for my ten-year-old son.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Puppy: 小狗。两岁以下都算哟。

3. Well, you've come to the right place. We have a number of puppies that are a perfect match for children.  
(您来对地方了。我们有几只小狗非常适合孩子们。)

4. 是啊，我昨天跟孩子来过了，我儿子很喜欢一只黑色的小狗。  
(Yes, I came here yesterday with my son. He really likes a black puppy.)

5. I think I know which one you're talking about. That puppy is six months old, very healthy and very friendly. It's also one of the best family and child-friendly breeds.  
(我想我知道你说的是哪只了。那只小狗 6 个月大，非常健康，也非常友善。小狗的品种也是最适合家庭和小朋友领养的品种之一呢。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Breed: 多义词。这里是名词，表示品种。  
例：What's your favorite breed of cat? 你最喜欢哪种猫呢？

6. 是的，小狗非常主动， 跟我儿子玩得可开心了呢。  
(Yes. That one is very active and played happily with my son.)

7. Yes. This puppy is very active and energetic. Its vaccinations are up-to-date and it has also been toilet trained. So, it will be a great friend for your son. Have you had a dog before?  
(是的，这只小狗非常活泼主动。它打了疫苗，也训练过上厕所了。所以, 它可以成为你儿子很棒的朋友。你之前养过狗吗？)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Toilet training 同义高频词：potty training 如厕训练例：Most children start potty training between 2 and 3 years of age.

8. 养过，但是没养过这么小的。请问您有什么建议吗？  
(Yes, but not this young. Do you have any advice, if I may ask?)

9. Well, puppies do require a lot of attention. They need to be exercised daily and have puppy food, which you can easily get from supermarkets.  
(嗯，小狗确实需要你多多关爱它，每天带它活动，也要吃小狗的狗粮。超市就能买到。)

10. 好的，我记住了。我了解到你们有针对宠物的训练课。我希望我的儿子能和小狗一起参加你们的训练课。  
(Okay, I'll keep that in mind. I learned that you have pet training course. I hope my son can attend it with the puppy.)

11. Sure. We have a pet training course every Saturday at 9 AM. It's in the park behind our center. Please fill out the adoption application form first.  
(当然可以。我们每周六早上九点有宠物训练课，地点就在我们中心后面的公园。请你先填写一下申请表吧。)

12. 好的。非常感谢你。  
(Okay. Thank you very much.)
