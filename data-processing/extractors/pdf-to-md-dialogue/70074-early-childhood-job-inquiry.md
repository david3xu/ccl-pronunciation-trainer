# 70074. Early Childhood Job Inquiry - Business & Education

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking Recruitment Manager and a mandarin-speaking woman, who is seeking jobs in the early education industry. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello. It's great to meet you in person. Please, Come in and take a seat please. How can I help you today?

(你好。很高兴见到你本人。请进来坐吧。我今天能怎么帮到你呢?)

2. 你好，我刚刚结束幼教课程，想找个适合我的工作。

(Hello. I've just completed my early childhood teaching course and I'd like to a job that suits me.)

3. That's great. In Australia, qualified child care workers is always in demand all times.

(那很好啊。在澳大利亚，合格的学前教育工作者是一直缺的。)

4. 是啊。我也非常热爱教小朋友。我觉得这是一份很有挑战性，但是也很有意义的工作。

(That's true. I also have a passion for teaching young children and I think it's a very challenging yet rewarding job.)

5. Yes, it can be challenging. After all, teaching a whole room of young children is no simple task. But it's also very rewarding.

(是啊，这份工作可能会很有挑战性。毕竟，要教一个班的小朋友可不简单。但是这份工作也非常有意义。)

6. 是啊。不过，我担心如果我去托儿所工作，可能就没有时间照顾我儿子了。

(That's true. But I'm concerned that I may not have time to look after my son if I work in a childcare centre.)

7. Don't worry. After you find a job, your son can attend the childcare center you are working for. In this way, you are also leaving making a good impression to your employer.

(别担心。你可以让你儿子去你工作的托儿所就读。而且，这样你还可以给雇主留一个好印象。)

8. 这真是一个好主意，太谢谢您了。对了，我想从兼职工作或者临时工做起。您还有什么其他的建议吗?

(That's really a good idea. Thank you so much. By the way, do you have any other advice if I want to start with part-time or casual jobs?)

9. In that case, you may try looking for jobs in the same suburb because it will definitely save your time and energy.

(这样的话，你可以试试在同一个区找工作，因为这样肯定省时又省力。)

10. 好的。我记住了。我很期待在这个行业工作，希望我能早点找到合适的工作。

(Okay, I'll keep that in mind. I'm really looking forward to working in this industry. I hope I can find a suitable job soon.)

11. That should not be a problem for you. You are passionate about early childhood teaching; you have a good educational background and I can tell that you're also a hard-worker. Besides, early childhood has always been a booming industry.

(那对你来说应该不是问题。因为你对学前教育有热情，你的教育背景也很好，并且我看得出你工作也会很努力。而且，早教行业也一直发展得很好。)

12. 您过奖了。不过，听您这么说，我确实松了一口气呀。非常感谢您。

(I'm really flattered. But it's indeed a relief to hear that. Thank you very much.)
