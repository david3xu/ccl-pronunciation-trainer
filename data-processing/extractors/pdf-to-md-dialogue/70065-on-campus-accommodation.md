# 70065. On-campus accommodation – Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Roger, an English-speaking student service assistant and a mandarin-speaking student. The student is looking for on-campus accommodation. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, I'm Roger and I work as a student service assistant. I help students with finding accommodation.  
(你好，我是学生服务助手罗杰。我负责帮助学生找到住宿的地方。)

2. 你好。我目前有一个住宿的地方。但是我现在想要找一个我上学时住的地方自己住。  
(Hello. I have a place to live now. But I want to find another place to live on my own on school days.)

3. I totally get that. Where you live will affect your studying experience. We have a wide range of on-campus and off-campus accommodation options and I'm sure you'll find your lovely new home quickly.  
(我懂。住的地方是会影响到学习的。我们提供多种多样的校内校外住宿，我相信你很快就能找到你满意的新家。)

4. 我班上有一些同学住在学生宿舍里。他们说，住在那里就好像住在家里一样。  
(Some of my classmates live in dormitories and they say it feels like home.)

5. That's true. Dorms can be really comfortable to live in. Besides, loads of students are happy that they don't have to cook for themselves.  
(是的。宿舍确实舒服。而且很多学生觉得，不用自己做饭特别好。)

Cook for oneself: 自己做饭  
Cook by oneself: 做饭的时候必须自己一个人，身边不能有别人(you have to cook with no one else around, or no one helping you.)

6. 确实啊！那你们有学生宿舍吗？  
(Exactly！Do you offer dormitories?)

7. Yes, we do. It comes with a bedroom and a bathroom, and laundry facilities are communal. Plus, food is provided every day.  
(有的。宿舍带一个房间，一个浴室, 洗衣房大家共用。另外，每天有伙食提供。)

8. 听起来很好！不过，我担心学生宿舍有时候有些吵。我还是想要安静点的地方。  
(That sounds great. But I'm concerned that dormitories can be noisy sometimes. I really want a quieter place.)

9. We also offer shared apartments on campus. All residents have their own room and you can choose to live in a standard room or a more costly "deluxe" room.  
(我们还提供在校内的合租公寓房。每个人都有自己的房间。你可以选标准间，或者是更贵一些的豪华间。)

住在学校里：live on campus 注意介词的使用

10. 好的。我来你办公室的路上，看到公告栏那里贴了一些租房广告。这些房子靠谱吗？  
(Okay. I've also seen some rental ads on the bulletin/notice board on the way to your office. Are they reliable?)

11. Well, they are actually off-campus private rentals and you may call them at the number on the board. Of course, you should always be aware of rental scams.  
(这些房子是私人出租的，并且在校外。你可以通过公告栏里提供的号码给他们打电话。当然啦，你要随时留意租房诈骗的可能。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Call someone on/at + 电话号码  
Scam: 名词/动词：欺诈

12. 好的。我想我更喜欢你说的学校公寓房，因为我还是想住在学校里面。罗杰，谢谢你的帮助！  
(Okay. I prefer the on-campus apartment you mentioned because I'd like to live inside the campus. Thank you for your help, Roger!)
