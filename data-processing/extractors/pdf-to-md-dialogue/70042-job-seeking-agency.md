#70042. Job Seeking Agency – Social welfare

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Davison, an officer from a job seeking agency and Ms. Li, a mandarin speaking mother of two children. The dialogue starts now.

1. Davison：Hello, Ms Li, thanks for coming today. I have good news for you.
(李女士你好，谢谢你今天过来。我有好消息告诉你。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
news 不可数，所以不要说 a good news, 如果要表示一个好消息可以说 a piece of good news

2. Ms. Li：真的吗？是什么好消息？您帮我找到工作了吗？
(Really? What's the good news? Have you found a job for me?)

3. Davison：Yes. Based on your previous work experience listed on your resume, I've found a part-time job for you in a bakery.
(是的，根据你简历上列出来的以往工作经验，我在一家面包房给你找了一份兼职工作。)

4. Ms. Li：太好了！这样我就可以补贴家用，还可以照顾我的两个孩子了。
(That's great! Then I can use the money to cover our living expenses and look after/take care of my two children.)

5. Davison：I'm glad to hear that. Your employer would like to give you a staff induction, where he'll brief you on the roster and your responsibilities in the workplace. It's next Thursday around 9:30 a.m. Do you think you'll be able to attend?
(听到这个我很高兴。你的老板想给你做一个入职培训，他会给你大概讲下执勤表的事情，还有你要负责班上/工作场所中的哪些事。时间是下周四早上, 大概九点半左右。你可以参加吗？)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
星期之前的介词使用，以 Thursday 为例，可以说 next Thursday/on Thursday/Every Thursday, 但是不能说 on next Thursday.

6. Ms. Li：我一定会去的。那天我会先把孩子送到学校，然后我就直接过去。您可以把地址发到我的邮箱里吗？
(I'll definitely be there. I'll drop the kids at school first and go straight there. Could you email the address to me?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
If you drop sb/sth (off) somewhere, you take them somewhere and leave them there: 将某人/某事送到某地

7. Davison：Sure. Your employer will also need you to sign and provide some documents on that day, such as your offer of employment, tax file number document and your nominated Superannuation fund.
(当然可以。那天你的老板也会需要你签一些文件，再提供一些材料，比如你的聘用书，税号文件，以及你指定的退休公积金的材料。)

8. Ms. Li：没问题。我前几天已经收到澳大利亚税务局给我发的税号了。现在我需要找一家管理退休金的公司就可以了，是吗？
(No problem. I've received my tax file number from the Australian Taxation Office several days before. Now I just need to have a Superannuation Provider, right?)

9. Davison：That's correct. I'll send you a list of Superannuation Providers. Your employer will also go through the safe work instructions with you and let you know how to report potential hazards in the workplace.
(是的。我会给你发一个管理退休公积金的公司名单的。你的老板也会带你过一遍工作安全指导，并且告知你如何报告工作中的潜在隐患/风险。)

10. Ms. Li：好的。我之前也学习过如何安全操作机器。我知道食品卫生非常重要, 遵循食品安全标准也很重要。
(Okay, I've learnt how to safely operate machinery before. I know that food hygiene is crucial and it's important to adhere to food safety standards.)

11. Davison：That's good to hear. I'll also attach your employer's contact details to the email in case you need to contact him.
(那很好啊。我在给你发的邮件里也附上了你老板的联系方式，以免你需要跟他联系。)

12. Ms. Li：好的。刚刚您说会推荐管理退休金的机构给我，我是可以自己选一家吗？
(Okay. You just said that you would recommend some Superannuation Providers to me. Do I get to pick one/Can I pick one by myself?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
萤火虫老师注：To "get to do" something means that you are enabled or given the opportunity to do something

13. Davison：Yes. I've got some printed materials and brochures, you can have a look.
(是的。我这有一些书面材料和小册子，你可以看看。)
