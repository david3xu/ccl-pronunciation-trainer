# 70068. Tree trimming - Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place over the phone between Simon, an English-speaking worker from a tree trimming company and a mandarin-speaking resident, who is calling to ask about the trimming of his six trees in the yard. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, this is Simon. How can I help you today?  
(你好，我是西蒙。我今天能如何帮到您呢？)

2. 你好，西蒙。三周前，你来我家，帮我砍了前院的四棵树。但是你工作还没做完，还有两棵树没砍。  
(Hello, Simon. You came to my place three weeks ago and cut down four trees in the front yard for me. However, your work is still not finished. There're still two trees left.)

砍树这个对话，不同同学回忆的数字细节不同，大家永远要以自己实际听到的为准

3. Yes, I remember that. That work turned out to be harder than I imagined because the trees are too close to your fence.  
(是的，我记得。那个活儿比我想象中的难一点，因为树离你家栅栏太近啦。)

4. 我付给你的钱是砍四棵树的，但是你只砍了两棵树。工作做得我很不满意。  
(I paid you for four trees but you've only trimmed two of them. I'm really unhappy about your work.)

5. I know. But it's harder than I imagined. I'll be back to finish it in three weeks.  
(我知道。但是这工作比我想象中的要难。我会在三周之后回去完成这个工作的。)

6. 我不想等那么久。我希望这个工作在冬天来之前就能完成。你可以下周任何时间过来，周末也可以。  
(I don't want to wait for that long. I hope the job can be done before winter. You can come to finish it any time next week including the weekend.)

7. Then I'll be there between 2-5 pm on Saturday. But the trees are indeed too close to the fence. I'll come back to finish the work early next week if it's not done on Saturday.  
(那我周六下午两点到五点之间过去。但是树确实离栅栏很近。如果周六工作做不完的话，我下周再早点回去弄完。)

8. 我听说下周有暴风雨。我怕树的树枝会掉到我的房子上。  
(I heard that there's a storm coming next week. I'm worried that the branches will fall on my house.)

这一段，有新回忆，说的是：我知道，近期有暴风雨。如果风更大的话，我怕树枝会掉到房子上。(I learn that there's a storming coming soon. I'm worried that the branches will fall on the house if the wind gets stronger.)

9. Yeah, that's what the weather forecast says, a storm next week. I'll finish the work before that if the trees are a hazard.  
(确实，预报下周有暴风雨。如果树比较危险的话，我会在那之前把它们砍掉的。)

10. 你从我邻居后院那边，能不能更好的够到树啊？我会去问问我邻居行不行的。  
(Do you think you'll have better access to the trees from my neighbor's backyard? I'll ask my neighbor if that's okay.)

11. That's a good idea. The work can be done more quickly if that's the case. I'll see you at 2pm on Saturday.  
(好主意。如果可以的话，工作就能更快完成了。周六两点见。)

12. 好的。周六见。  
(Okay. See you on Saturday.)
