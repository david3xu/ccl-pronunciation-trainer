# 70082. Rent an apartment-Business

**Briefing:** The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking person who is making an enquiry about a rental application and Anni, an English-speaking real estate agent. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning! I'm Anni and I'm a real estate agent. Have you already looked around at the apartment?
(早上好，我是安妮，我是一名房产中介。您已经看过这个公寓了吗？)

2. 你好，安妮。我已经看过公寓了。这个公寓真好啊！我有些问题想问您。
(Hello, Anni. I have inspected this apartment. This is such a lovely apartment! I have some questions for you.)

3. Sure. May I ask what you'd like to know?
(当然可以了。请问您想了解些什么呢？)

4. 我注意到洗衣房里有一台洗衣机。这套公寓里面有洗衣机吗？我是没有洗衣机的。如果公寓里有，就太方便啦。
(I noticed that there's a washing machine in the laundry. Is there a washing machine in this apartment? I don't have one. It would be quite convenient if the apartment comes with one.)

5. Yes, this apartment comes with a washing machine. It will be very convenient. You don't need to buy one for yourself.
(是的，这套公寓里是带洗衣机的。这就非常方便了。您不用自己买洗衣机了。)

6. 那太好啦。我在来的时候，我看到别的公寓里有只小狗。请问这个公寓可以养狗吗？
(That's great. On my way here, I saw a puppy/little dog in another apartment. May I ask if I can have a dog in the apartment?)

7. Yes, there're some rules though. You also need to get permission from the owner. Keeping large animals is not allowed. But usually a small animal such as a kitten or a puppy is acceptable.
(可以的。不过您要遵守一些规定。您还要得到房主的允许。养大型动物是不行的。不过通常来说，像小猫小狗这样的小动物是可以的。)

8. 我自己没有狗，但是我确实想买一只。租客要能在公寓里养小狗，真的是太棒了。
(I don't have a dog. However, I do want to buy one. It would be great if tenants are allowed to have puppies in their apartments.)

9. Some tenants do have small pets. They fill the apartment building with happiness for everyone.
(有些租客确实养了小宠物。它们让这个公寓楼里的每个人都感觉到了满满的开心/感觉到非常开心。)

10. 太好啦。我在你们的网站上看到了租房申请表。我已经填完了。我觉得应该没什么问题。
(That's great. I saw a rental application form on your website and I have already filled it out. I think there should be no problem.)

11. It certainly won't be a problem. Your application is the first one I have received regarding this apartment. Let me check the relevant details…yes, everything is good. There should be no problem.
(当然没问题的。您的申请是我收到的关于这个公寓的第一份申请。让我来看看相关的细节信息…嗯，都很好。应该没问题的。)

12. 谢谢你！我填表的时候特别小心，因为英语不是我的第一语言。如果申请成功了，我希望我能尽早知道啦。
(Thank you! I was very careful when I was filling out the form, because English is not my first language. I hope I could know as soon as possible if the application is successful.)

13. I'll go through all the applications next Monday and then make a decision. If your rental application is approved, I'll give you a call and ask you to come sign the rental agreement.
(我会在下周一的时候看一下所有的申请，然后作决定。如果您的租房申请通过了，我会给您打电话，让您过来签租赁协议。)

14. 我真的很喜欢这个公寓。期待下周一接到您的电话！
(I really like this apartment. I'm looking forward to your call next Monday!)
