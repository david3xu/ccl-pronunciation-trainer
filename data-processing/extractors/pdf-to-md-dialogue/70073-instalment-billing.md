# 70073. Instalment Billing - Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place over the phone between an English-speaking staff member from an energy company and a mandarin-speaking client, who's having difficulties paying the bill.

1. Hello. This is Anita. You are getting through the financial support team.

(你好。我是安妮塔。这里是经济援助团队。)

2. 你好，我收到了新的电费账单，比我原来想的要高很多。我没有办法支付。

(Hello, I received my new electricity bill and it's much higher than what I imagined. So, I'm not able to pay it.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Bill: 账单
煤气费账单: Gas bill
电话费账单: phone bill
请帮我买单: May I have/get the bill/check please?

3. Could you tell me more about it? I'm sure we can find a way to help you.

(你能再说具体些吗?我相信我们能找到解决办法来帮你。)

4. 这个冬天太冷了，我的孩子还很小，需要长时间待在温暖的室内。所以我们开暖气的时间比较长。

(This winter is so cold. My child is still too young and needs to always stay in a warm indoor place. So, we're running the heater for longer hours.)

5. Well, no one could have anticipated such a cold winter. I think you'll find many people are experiencing similar cases to yours.

(没人想到这个冬天能这么冷。我想，你会发现有很多人和你情况相似的。)

6. 我本来是可以付清电费的，但是我不再全职工作了。我现在兼职工作。

(I could have paid the bill, but I'm no longer working full-time. I'm working part-time now.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Could have done: 本可以做但是没做成

7. I think I can apply for an extension for you so that you have four more weeks to prepare make your payment.

(我想我可以给你申请延期还款，这样你还可以有四周的时间来准备还款。)

8. 非常抱歉，我想这还是不够。我现在手头真的很紧。

(I'm very sorry but I don't think that's enough for me. Money is really tight for me at the moment.)

9. I think our payment plan would help you. It allows you to make small payments over a longer period of time.

(我想，我们的付款计划可以帮到你。你可以在一段时间内，分多次，每次支付一小部分金额。)

10. 那太好啦。您能告诉我付款计划是怎么操作的吗?

(That's great. Could you tell me how that works?)

11. We'll divide the full amount into three parts so that you can repay within three months. In this way, you just need to pay a smaller sum each month.

(我们可以把总额分成三部分，分三个月还清。这样，你每个月就可以只还比较少的钱了。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Sum: an amount of money 金额; 一笔钱
例: Large sums of money are spent on face masks.
必考高频词: Lump sum payment 一次性付款

12. 太好啦，非常感谢你。

(That's great. Thank you so much.)
