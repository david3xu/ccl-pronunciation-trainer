你好，感谢您百忙之中抽空见我。
Hello! Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to see me.

2.
Hello, that's totally fine. What can I do for you?
你好！这没有什么。我能为你做些什么呢？

3.
我最近买了一块地。我想建一个我做梦都想要的房子。而且这块地已经有了建筑许可证，我可以建一个两层砖木结构的房子。
I bought a block of land recently. I would like to build my dream house. And I've got a building permit for this block of land to build a two-storey brick veneer house.

4.
We have 10 years' professional experience in this industry. And we are fully licensed. We are a fully insured company. I am sure we can help you build your dream house.
我们在这个行业有10年的专业经验。我们有全部的执照和全部的保险，我相信我们可以帮你建造你梦想中的房子。

5.
是的，我的中介也强烈推荐您。既然您在这一行业有那么好的经验。您能告诉我大致的建房步骤是什么吗？
Right, my agent strongly recommended you too. Since you have such great experience in this industry, could you briefly let me know the steps of building a house?

6.
Normally there are 4 steps. Step one is signing a contract.
通常有四个步骤。第一步是签订合同。

7.
哦，是这样。合同中一般有什么呢？
Ok, I see, then what's usually included in the contract?

8.
The contract will have the design and details of the floor plan, the lump sum of payment, available payment methods and stages of payment.
合同里会有平面图的细节信息，设计信息，一次性付款信息，可选的付款方式和付款步骤。

9.
哦，那是不是签完合同就可以立即开工了呢？
All right. Would you be able to start once the contract is signed?

10.
Yes, we will start to build after you sign the contract.
是的，签合同后我们就会开始建房子。

11.
好的，那另外两个步骤是什么呢？
Ok, what are the other two steps then?

12.
The other two steps include a final inspection after the building is completed. If you are satisfied with the construction, we will hand over the keys to you.
另外两个步骤包括房子建好后的最终验房。如果您觉得房子盖得很满意，我们会把钥匙交给您。

13.
好的，既然你们在这个行业如此有权威，那我相信我们的工程会进展很顺利。
Ok, since you are a leading authority in the industry/an industry guru, I believe our project will go smoothly.
