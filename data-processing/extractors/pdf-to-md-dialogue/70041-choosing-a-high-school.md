#70041. Choosing a High School - Education

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Anna, a high school principal and a mandarin speaking mother who would like to choose a high school for her daughter. The dialogue starts now.

1. Anna：Good afternoon, I'm Anna, the principal of the school. It's nice to meet you.
(下午好，我是安娜。我是这所学校的校长。很高兴见到你。)

2. Mother：你好，校长。你们的校园真漂亮啊！
(Hi, Principal. This is such a beautiful campus!)

3. Anna：Thank you. Welcome to Rockfield High School. Please take a seat.
(谢谢。欢迎来到洛克菲尔德中学。请坐吧。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
澳洲中学是 high school, 或者 secondary school/college, 从 7 年级到 12 年级，初中高中都在一起，不像国内的很多初高中都是分开的。

4. Mother：我女儿即将要从小学毕业了。我们正在找哪个高中的课程最适合她。
(My daughter is about to graduate from primary school. We're looking for a high school with the right programs for her.)

这里中文的原文说的就是"高中"。

5. Anna：I can understand it is a stressful time for all parents, and this is also very exciting! This depends on how you look at it.
(我理解这段时间对于所有的家长来说都是很有压力的，同时也是很让人兴奋的。这取决于你怎么看啦。)

6. Mother：是啊。这真是头痛。有很多方面需要考虑。不过，最让人关心的是孩子能从学校学到什么。
(Yes. This gives us headaches. We need to think carefully in so many ways. But what we care most about is what our kid could learn from a school.)

7. Anna：When your daughter came to the school on our open day, the form she filled in states that she particularly likes art, which is one of our school's strong points.
(您女儿开放日来我们学校时，填写的表格里说她特别喜欢艺术。艺术是我们学校的强项之一。)

8. Mother：我先生是室内设计师, 她可能是被父母影响到了。她特别喜欢艺术。那你能告诉我学校具体有哪些艺术课程吗？
(My husband is an interior designer. She's probably influenced by her parents. She really likes art. Then could you tell me what specific art programs you have here?)

9. Anna：Apart from drawing, sculpture, and design, which you may have seen on our open day, we also provide photography programs. We also have a teacher who is specialized in Chinese ink and water painting.
(除了绘画，雕塑和设计这些你可能在开放日看过的，我们还有摄影课。我们还有一位专长中国水墨画的老师。)

10. Mother：那你们的数学怎么样呢？考虑到作为艺术家，维持生计或许会很困难, 如果艺术可以结合其他实用的课程，她的前途就有保障了。
(Then what about your Math? Given that it may be difficult to make a living as an artist, she could have a secured future if there are some other practical programs on top of art.)

11. Anna：Actually, our school is also very good at math and science. Last year, our school team won the first place of the State's science competition.
(其实我们学校的数学和科学都非常好。去年我们校队拿了州科学竞赛的第一名。)

12. Mother：那太好了！这是很好的成绩。作为校长，你一定很自豪吧？
(That's wonderful! That's such an amazing result. You must have been very proud as the Principal.)

13. Anna：Yes. Indeed. You don't have to worry about our school's academic standard. We'll ensure that we provide our students with above-average education.
(是啊。确实。你不需要太担心我们学校的学术水平。我们会确保给我们的学生提供高水准的教育服务。)

14. Mother：我会再跟我女儿谈谈。我希望我们尽快解决这件事。谢谢你提供的这些介绍。
(I'll have another talk with my daughter. Hopefully, we could settle this as soon as possible. Thank you for the introduction.)
