#70212. Newcomer Navigates Waste Sorting and Gardening - Business

1.
Hi! We haven't had a proper chat since you moved here! Found any good spots around here?
你好呀！自从你搬来，我们还没怎么好好聊过呢！发现附近有什么好地方了吗？

2.
你好。我暂时只摸清了超市和学校。不过，昨天我发现，这里的垃圾分类很不同。我正想找人问问呢。
Hi! So far, I've just figured out the supermarket and the school. But yesterday I noticed the waste sorting system here is quite different. I was just wanting to ask someone about it.

3.
Ah! The Aussie bin system! That confuses everyone at first. Tell me what's puzzling you?
啊！澳洲的垃圾桶系统啊！刚开始确实让人糊涂。跟我说说你哪里不明白呀？

4.
比如，为什么有三个不同颜色的垃圾桶？还有哪些垃圾要单独处理吗？
Like, why are there three different colored bins? And what waste needs separate handling?

5.
Well, the red lid is for general waste, the yellow one is for recycling, and the green one is for organics. Some items, like batteries, need special drop-off. Most supermarkets take them.
嗯，红色盖子装普通垃圾，黄色回收，绿色有机垃圾。像电池这种特殊物品要单独处理。多数超市都有回收点。

6.
哦，所以，电池要单独处理呀。那么，旧的电子设备，我该扔到哪里呀？
Oh, so batteries need separate handling. Where should I dispose of old electronic devices then?

7.
The City Council holds an e-waste collection day quarterly. The next one will be in October, at the community centre.
市政厅会每个季度办电子垃圾回收日，下次在十月，地点在社区中心。

8.
了解了。我还想种菜，我需要买几个高架菜床、一根浇水软管，还有其他园艺工具。你知道在哪里买吗？
Got it. I also want to grow some vegetables. I need to get a few raised garden beds, a watering hose, and some other gardening tools. Do you know where to buy them?

9.
I'd say, the gardening centre along the highway is your best bet. It's quite big, and usually has a wider range of stuff.
我觉得公路那边的园艺中心是你最好的选择。那地方挺大的，通常种类也更多。

10.
太好了。我搬家的时候啥园艺工具都没带过来。运费实在太贵了。所以现在我得重新添置一批。
Great. I didn't bring any gardening tools with me when I moved here. The shipping costs are too high. So now I've got to buy everything again.

11.
I see. Picking out new tools can actually be pretty fun. Plus, that place isn't too pricey, which is a bonus.
我明白。其实挑新的工具也挺有意思的。而且那家店的价格不太贵，这算是个额外的好处。

12.
太好了。我已经迫不及待想种点东西了，就是这边的环境跟我的祖国那边差很多。
Great. I really can't wait to plant something, it's just that the environment here is so different from back home.

13.
How about I come with you to the gardening centre now? We can pick plants that grow well in our soil.
要不我现在陪你去园艺中心？我们可以选些适合本地土壤的植物。

14.
那太好了！我正担心选错植物呢。我们走吧，我开车，你可以坐副驾，给我指指路呀！
That'd be wonderful! I was just worried about choosing the wrong plants. Let's go. I'll drive, and you can sit up front and guide me.
