# 70047. Blood Test - Medical

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a mandarin-speaking male patient with a blood phobia and a nurse at a local clinic. The patient is about to have a blood test. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning! Won't you come in? What seems to be the problem?
(早上好！请进！您怎么了？)

34. 您好，我是来验血的。我有医生的转诊信。
(Hello. I'm here to have a blood test. I have a referral letter from a doctor.)

35. Well, you've come to the right place. Let me have a look at the referral letter.
(那您就来对地方啦。让我来看一眼转诊信。)

36. 给您。我一见到血就头晕。我现在有一点紧张。
(Here it is. I feel dizzy at the sight of blood. I'm a little nervous now.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
晕血，习惯的口语说法还是 faint at the sight of blood, CCL 三分钟中翻英课堂里面也有配合美剧的讲解，可以翻阅一下加深印象

5. Don't worry, you'll only feel a prick when the needle first pierces your skin. We can also use a numbing spray to numb the area before I draw the blood.
(别担心。针头刚扎入你的皮肤时，你只会感觉到一点点刺痛。在抽血之前，我们还会用麻醉喷雾来麻醉注射区域的。)

37. 哎呀，我一见到血就头晕。我真的不行，看到血我真会晕倒。我一想到血，或者一提到血，也会觉得头晕。
(Gosh, I feel dizzy at the sight of blood. I really can't do it. I'll literally faint at the sight of blood. Even the thought of blood or the mere mention of blood can make me feel dizzy.)

38. Just relax and take a deep breath. Are you right or left-handed?
(您就放轻松，深呼吸。您惯用右手还是左手呢？)

39. 我是右撇子。不过您为什么问这个呢？这个和验血有关吗？
(I'm right-handed. But why would you ask that? Does it have anything to do with my blood test?)

40. If it's the arm you often use, you may have some bruising or swelling where the blood was drawn. To make yourself more comfortable, you can lie down and look away, instead of sitting up. You can even pretend that you are relaxing on a beach to distract yourself.
(如果在你常常使用的胳膊上抽血，抽过血的地方可能会有淤青和肿痛。你还可以躺下, 或者看向另一边，不用坐着。你甚至还可以想象你正在沙滩上休息，来转移注意力。)

41. 这主意不错。我只需要深呼吸来帮我放松。我可以想象在一个风光明媚的日子里，我在一个美丽的瀑布旁边。
(That's a good idea. I just need to take a deep breath, which can help me relax. I can imagine that it's a lovely sunny day and I'm next to a beautiful waterfall.)

42. Okay. Please make a fist and I'll tell you when to unclench it. I need to see the vein. Okay, all done. You can sit up when you're ready. Please sign your name here.
(好的。请您握拳，需要松开手的时候我会告诉您的。我需要看到血管。好的，都做完了，您觉得可以的时候就能坐起来了/您整理好就可以坐起来了。请在这里签上您的名字。)

43. 啊？已经结束了呀？我没有一点感觉啊！谢谢您的耐心服务。
(What？All done? I didn't feel it at all! Thank you for your patience.)
