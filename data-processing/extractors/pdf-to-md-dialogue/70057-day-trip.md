# 70057. Day trip - Education

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place over the phone between Mrs. Yang, a mandarin-speaking mother and Miss Price, an English-speaking primary school teacher. Mrs Yang is making an inquiry about her daughter's day trip. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, Mrs. Yang. This is Miss. Press. I'm calling to discuss our plan of taking our class to a day trip. Is that alright?  
(杨太太你好。我是普莱斯老师。我打电话是想跟你讨论一下带全班学生一日游的计划。可以吗？)

2. 你好，普莱斯老师，没有问题。我女儿是第一次去海边。她非常兴奋。  
(Hello，Miss. Press. No problem. It's my daughter's first time going to the beach. She's very excited.)

3. Yes, all the kids are looking forward to it. I believe our bus leaves at 7a.m. tomorrow. Please make sure your daughter has breakfast before departure.  
(是啊，所有的孩子都很期待呢。我想我们的大巴是明早七点出发的，请确保您的女儿在出发前吃好早饭。)

4. 好的。那我需要给她准备午餐吗？  
(Okay. Do I need to prepare lunch for her?)

5. No. There's a Café which provides food at the destination and the kids get to choose the food they like from a menu provided.  
(不用的。目的地那里有个咖啡厅，可以提供餐食。孩子们可以从他们提供的菜单里选他们爱吃的。)

6. 他们提供健康食品吗？我不想让我的女儿那天吃太多垃圾食品。  
(Do they provide healthy food? I don't want my daughter to have too much junk food on that day.)

7. Don't worry. We have been working with the Café for decades and the food they provide is all very healthy and delicious. Actually, they have been very dedicated to providing children with healthy and nutritious food.  
(您放心。我们跟咖啡馆已经合作几十年了，他们提供的食物都是非常健康可口的。其实，这家咖啡馆一直致力于给孩子提供健康营养的食物。)

Be dedicated to doing sth: 致力于做某事

8. 谢谢您。那我就放心了。另外，孩子们会去游泳吗？我有一点担心。您也知道，我们一家才刚到澳大利亚。我女儿没去过海边，她不会游泳啊。  
(Thank you. That's a relief. Also, are the kids going to swim? I'm a bit worried. As you know, we've just arrived in Australia. My daughter has never been to the beach and she doesn't swim.)

9. No, swimming is not included in our plan. Tomorrow's day trip is mainly about exploring the beautiful coastline and rock pools. You need to pack sunscreen in her bag though.  
(不会的，我们没有让孩子们游泳的计划。明天的一日游主要是去探索美丽的海岸线和岩池。不过，你需要给孩子在包里装好防晒霜。)

Rock pool: a small pool between rocks on the edge of the sea.岩池

10. 那我就放心了。我会让她一直随身带着防晒霜的。关于这次旅行，还有什么需要我知道的吗？  
(That's a relief. I'll make sure she carries it with her all the time. Is there anything else that I should know about this trip?)

11. You also need to fill in the permission slip for you daughter and you need to make sure that you sign it and please provide us with your contact number in case of an emergency.  
(你还需要为你的女儿填写一下同意书，要确保在上面签字，并且告知我们你的紧急联系电话。)

12. 我能给您我丈夫的电话吗？我早上先把我的女儿送到巴士上，之后我就要去上班了。  
(May I give you my husband's number? I'll first drop my daughter off on the bus that morning and then I need to go to work.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Drop someone/something off: 将某人/某事送到某处并放下例句：Please drop me off at the airport.

13. Yes, as long as he's available when emergency happens.  
(可以的，只要在发生紧急情况的时候，我们能联系上他就可以。)

14. 太好了。我会把这个表格填好签字的。我会确保我丈夫在紧急情况的时候是联系得到的。谢谢你，普莱斯老师。我们明早七点见。  
(Great. I'll fill in the form and sign it. I'll make sure my husband is available in the case of an emergency. Thank you, Miss Price. I'll see you at 7am tomorrow.)
