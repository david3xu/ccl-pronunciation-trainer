# 70086. Health Care Card and Food Parcel - Social

**Briefing:** The following dialogue takes place over the phone between an English-speaking employee of a local community centre and a Mandarin-speaking parent who has difficulty paying the bills. The parent is calling to ask for help. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good afternoon. Thanks for calling the community centre. How can I help you?
(下午好。感谢致电社区中心。我能如何帮到您呢？)

2. 你好。我的女儿生病了，我没有足够的钱来给她买药，支付账单跟买食物。
(Hello. My daughter is sick. I don't have enough money to buy her medicine, pay the bills or buy any food.)

3. I'm sure we can find a way to help. I'm sorry to hear that your daughter is sick. I hope she recovers soon.
(我确定我们可以想到办法来帮你的。抱歉听到你女儿生病了。我希望她能早点康复。)

4. 她需要服药三个月。为了支付她的医药费，我都在做兼职工作以便照顾她。但是钱还是不够付清全部的账单。
(She needs to be on medication for three months. I'm working part time so that I can cover her medical expenses and take care of her. But the money is still not enough to cover all the bills.)

5. I understand. It must BE difficult to manage money when there's extra medical costs.
(我能理解。有额外的医药费开销的时候，把钱管理好一定很困难吧。)

6. 我只能选择先付最重要的费用，像是医药费跟房租。有时候电费跟电话费我都没办法付了。我担心这些服务会被停掉。
(I have to pay the most important ones first, like her medical expenses and our rent. Sometimes I'm not even able to pay our electricity and phone bills. I'm worried that those services may be turned off.)

7. The electricity and mobile company can make a payment plan for you, so you have more time to pay. Just give them a call and explain your situation.
(电力和电话公司可以帮你制定付款计划的，这样你就能有更多的时间去交费了。你只需要给他们打个电话，解释一下你的情况就好。)

8. 我不知道还可以这样做。如果有更多时间来付款的话，就简单多了。
(I didn't know that's an option. It would be much easier if I have more time.)

9. You can also buy groceries at our food warehouse. We provide fresh packed food which is cheaper for families experiencing financial difficulties.
(你还可以在我们的食品仓库买杂货。对于有经济困难的家庭，我们是有价格更低的新鲜包装食品提供的。)

10. 谢谢你。要给家人准备好的三餐真的不容易。我也担心我的女儿会吃不好。
(Thank you. It's not easy to prepare three decent meals for the family. I'm also worried that my daughter can't eat well.)

11. All you need to do is to show us your health care card. Then you can purchase them from us at a cheaper price than those in the supermarket.
(您只需要跟我们出示一下您的保健卡, 然后您就可以用比超市低的价格在我们这儿买东西啦。)

12. 我明天可以去仓库吗？我这周的食物已经不多了。
(May I go to the warehouse tomorrow? I don't have enough food left for this week.)

13. It's closed tomorrow. It only opens three times a week. But if you come to the centre tomorrow, I can organize an emergency service for you including a food parcel.
(仓库明天关门。仓库只开三次。但是如果明天你来我们中心，我可以给您安排紧急服务，给您提供食品包。)

14. 太好了。感谢你提供的信息和支持。
(That's great. Thanks for your information and support.)
