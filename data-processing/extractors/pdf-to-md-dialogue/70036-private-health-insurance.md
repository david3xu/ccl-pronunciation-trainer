#70036. Private Health Insurance - Legal & Business

1.
Hello, this is John from Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. How can I help you?
你好。我是私人医保监查委员会的约翰。我能如何帮到您呢？

2.
你好，我买了一家私人医疗保险，但是我发现，有些医院收费比国民医保的准许金额要高。
Hello. I purchased private health insurance, but I found that some hospitals charge more than the amount Medicare approves.

3.
Hospitals can charge you up to 15% more than the amount Medicare approves. You can get 100% reimbursement of the approved-amount if you are an Australian citizen.
医院可以比国民医保批准金额多收最高 15%。如果你是澳大利亚公民，你可以获得批准金额的全额报销。

4.
这不是保险公司骗人吗？之前他们都没有告诉我，需要是澳大利亚公民才能 100%报销。
So, the insurance company was lying. They have never told me that I need to be an Australian citizen to get 100% reimbursement.

5.
I'm sorry to hear that. I suggest that you can lodge a complaint if that is not explained in your contract.
听到这个我很抱歉。我建议，如果这在你的合同中没有解释，你可以递交投诉。

6.
投诉会如何帮到我呢？我需要律师吗？
How can that help me? Do I need a lawyer?

7.
Not for now. I'll contact the insurance company representing you.
暂时不需要律师。我会代表您跟保险公司联系的。

8.
谢谢你。投诉如果成功，以后我就可以增加赔付金额了吗？
Thank you. If the complaint is successful, can my insurance payout increase afterwards?

9.
I'm afraid not, but insurance companies may make changes in the future because of it.
我恐怕不会。但是这可能会让将来的保险公司因此作出改变。

10.
这对我其实没什么区别。不过这样能帮到以后的消费者，也是好的呀。
It actually won't make any difference to me, but it's good that it will help the consumers afterwards.

11.
We also hope so. Changes are made based on the needs of clients and their reactions.
我们也希望这样。变化是根据客户的需求和反应做出的。

12.
是啊，有些保险公司保险费一直在涨，但是免责项目越来越多，自费的费用越来越高，真是让人失望。
Yes. The premiums of some insurance companies keep increasing, but there are more and more exclusions and out-of-pocket fees. This is so disappointing.

13.

好的，那您帮我递交投诉吧。非常感谢您。
