#70008. Suspected Drug Taking - Medical

1.
Good morning, Mrs Jin. I understand that you would like to discuss about your son John's suspected drug taking with me, is that right?
早上好，金太太。我理解你想跟我聊一聊你儿子约翰疑似吸毒的事情，对吗？

2.
医生你好。是的，我很担心我儿子，我想我的儿子正在吸毒，我很担心他。
Hello, doctor. Yes, I'm very concerned about my son. I think he's taking drugs. I'm so worried about him.

3.
Before we get into more details, are you sure that he's on drugs? I mean, actually there are many different kinds of drugs, including meth, ecstasy, marijuana, heroin, cocaine and amphetamine. Could you give me more details, please?
在我们讨论更多细节信息之前，你确定他在吸毒吗？我是说，毒品实际上有很多种，包括冰毒，摇头丸，大麻，海洛因，可卡因和安非他命。你可以告诉我更多细节信息吗？

4.
这是我最近在给他洗衣服的时候发现的。他的衣服上有很难闻的烟味。并且有时候他回到家之后，昏昏沉沉，眼睛也红红的。听我儿子最好的朋友的母亲Janette说，这是吸食大麻的表现。
I found that when I was washing his clothes a while ago. There was a terrible smoke smell on his clothes. Apart from that, sometimes after he got home, he was drowsy with red eyes. According to Janette, who is my son's best friend's mother, those are the symptoms of taking marijuana.

5.
Well, these are indeed symptoms of using marijuana, but let's not jump into conclusion yet, Mrs. Jin. Have you noticed any mood swings or behavioral change with him lately?
这个嘛，这些确实是吸食大麻的症状。不过金太太，咱们先别急着下结论啊。你有没有注意到最近他是否有什么情绪波动，或者行为举止上的变化吗？

6.
是的。他有时候变得非常暴躁，很容易生气，但是有的时候他又会突然变得很开心。而且他以前从来都不去国家公园和音乐节，但是现在他都会去了，而且是他的朋友们来接他去的。
Yes. Sometimes he is very grumpy and easily irritated, but sometimes he suddenly becomes very happy. Also, he never went to National parks or music festivals before. However, he goes to those places now and his friends would pick him up.

7.
Using marijuana not only has a negative impact on his emotions and behaviors, but is also harmful to his stomach, intestines and lungs. Have you talked about all these with him?
吸食大麻不仅仅对他的情绪和行为有不好的影响，也会对他的肠胃和肺有伤害。你有跟他坦诚地聊过这些吗？

8.
我有谈过的。但是我儿子说，吸食大麻的危害比抽烟小多了。他还说，在美国和澳大利亚，吸食大麻是合法的。
I did, but my son said that the harm of taking marijuana was much lower than that of smoking cigarette. He also said that it was legal to take marijuana in America and Australia.

9.
Not really. It is legal to smoke, sell and possess marijuana in many states in America. However, Australia doesn't authorize the legitimate usage for individuals. It's only legal for scientific and medical purposes nationwide.
并非如此。在美国的很多州，吸食，出售和持有大麻是合法的。然而，在澳大利亚，个人使用大麻并未得到许可，它的合法使用仅限于全国性的科研和医用。

10.
天呐，那我现在该怎么办呀？听说吸食大麻对他的身心都有很大的伤害。我不想让这个毁了他的一生。我想让他有个新的开始。求你帮帮他吧！
My goodness. Then what should I do now? I heard that taking marijuana is harmful to him physically and mentally. I don't want this to ruin his life. I want him to have a new start. Please help him!

11.
He can go to alcohol and smoking rehabilitation programmes for problem teenagers. And also, his school counsellor and psychologist will help him. I will write the referral.
他可以参加为问题青少年设立的戒烟戒酒康复项目。与此同时，他的学校辅导员和心理医生也会帮助他。我会写转诊信的。

12.
那就麻烦你帮我写转诊信了，非常感谢你医生。
Then please help me with the referral letter. Thank you very much, doctor.
