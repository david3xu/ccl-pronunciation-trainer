#70198. Flight Change Request After New Job Start - Tourism+Business

1.
Good afternoon, thank you for calling our Airline Customer Service. How may I assist you today?
下午好，感谢您致电我们航司客服部，今天有什么可以帮您的吗？

2.
下午好，我想咨询一下我下个月航班的事情，我有一些疑问。
Good afternoon, I'd like to make an enquiry about my flight next month. I have a few questions.

3.
Absolutely! Thank you for flying with us. I'd be glad to answer any questions you have about your reservation.
当然！感谢您乘坐我们的航班。我很乐意为您解答有关预订的任何问题。

4.
大概三个月前，我在你们官网订了票，并且已经付款了。现在我想更改预定，但是我不太清楚流程。
I booked and paid for my ticket on your website about three months ago. I'd like to change my reservation now, but I'm not sure how to proceed.

5.
Sure thing. I'm happy to help! Could you give me your flight details so I can check what options are available?
当然可以。我很乐意帮忙！能告诉我您的航班信息吗？我来看看有哪些可行的方案。

6.
本来我是打算去度假的，可我刚入职一个新工作，现在请不了假。
I planned to go on vacation, but I just started a new job and can't take time off now.

7.
Congrats on your new position! I'm sorry you won't make the trip—that's really unfortunate.
恭喜您找到新工作！很遗憾您度假度不成了，太不巧了。

8.
是的，我也没想好该怎么办。我正在考虑要么改期，要么退票取消预定。
Yes, I haven't decided what to do yet. I'm thinking either to push the flight to a later date or cancel and get a refund.

9.
Alright. When do you think you might get leave? Some tickets can be rescheduled or canceled, but fees may apply.
好的。您估计您什么时候能休假？有些票可以改期或者取消，但可能会收取一些费用。

10.
我知道会有些额外费用，希望不要太贵。我还不确定能休假的确切时间，需要跟我的新雇主商量一下。他说过年底应该可以请假。
I know there will be extra fees—hopefully not too expensive. I don't have a firm leave date yet; I need to discuss it with my new employer, who said I could take time off by year's end.

11.
It depends on your fare class, but fees are usually modest. You'll get refunded the balance after cancellation. You probably need to act soon and read the terms of your ticket carefully. Some discounted tickets aren't changeable.
这要看您的票种，不过一般手续费不高。取消后差额会退还。您可能得尽快操作，并仔细阅读机票的条款。有些特价票不能更改。

12.
好的，我回去看看我机票的种类，再给你回电。你们网站上能查到这些信息吗？
Okay, I'll check my fare type and call you back. Is that info available on your website?

13.
Yes. You can find all terms and fees on our site. If anything's unclear, feel free to call back.
没问题，您可以在我们网站上查看所有条款和费用。如有疑问，您尽管给我们打电话。

14.
好的，我会上网查一下怎么处理，权衡权衡这些选择。谢谢你的帮助！
Alright, I'll go online to see how to handle this and weigh my options. Thanks for your help!
