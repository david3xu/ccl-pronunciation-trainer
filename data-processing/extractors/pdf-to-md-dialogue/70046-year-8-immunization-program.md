Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a nurse and a mandarin speaking mother, whose child is currently in year 8. The mother is making an enquiry regarding her son's immunization. The dialogue starts now.

1. 你好，我收到你们一封关于儿童免疫接种的信。我能问一下，这封信是讲什么的吗？
(Hello, I received a letter from you concerning immunisation for children. May I ask what this letter is about?)

注意最后一句，宾语从句+疑问句的时候，疑问句需要改用陈述句语序。

2. Let me see. Yes, Year 8 students are offered free vaccines through the National Immunization Program to protect against some diseases.
(让我看一下。是的，八年级的学生可以通过国民免疫计划，免费接种疫苗，来抵御一些疾病。)

19. 原来是这样。那我需要做些什么呢？
(I see. What do I need to do then?)

20. You need to read the Consent Form and Vaccine Fact Sheet carefully, and then sign the Consent Form.
(你需要仔细阅读同意书和疫苗的情况说明书，然后在同意书上签字。)

21. 好的。那我需要在同意书上填写我儿子的健康状况和过敏史吗？
(Okay. Do I need to include my son's health condition and allergies in the Consent Form?)

22. Yes. You need to fill in the form regarding your child's allergy history to make sure that he has no severe allergies caused by vaccines. Has he had any allergic reactions before?
(是的。你需要在表格上填写你孩子的过敏史，确保他没有疫苗引起的严重过敏反应。他之前有过敏反应吗？)

23. 是的。他的免疫力不太好。之前接种免疫以后，他会发低烧，而且脸和身体其他部位会起疹子。
(Yes. He has low immunity. He would have a low-grade fever after immunization and he's also prone to have rashes on his face and other parts of the body.)

24. Okay, I'll note that down. Do you think that his allergic reaction may have been triggered by some medication?
(好的。我会把这些记下来。你觉得他的过敏反应会不会是其他药物引起的？)

25. 我孩子并没有定期服用什么药物啊。我想问一下，接种疫苗也会导致过敏发生吗？
(My child is not on medication. If I may ask: can immunization cause allergies?)

26. Well, severe side effects after vaccination are not common cases. There are usually underlying causes.
(嗯，接种免疫后，严重的副作用并不多见。通常还会有根本原因。)

27. 您说的根本原因是指什么呢？
(What do you mean by underlying causes?)

28. It may have something to do with his immune system. Maybe he's allergic to something, or maybe he's on regular medication that may weaken his immune system.
(可能是跟他的免疫系统有关。可能他对什么过敏，或者可能是他正在服用降低免疫力的药物。)

29. 我倒是没注意到我儿子对什么过敏。他也没有长期服用降低免疫力的药物。接种完免疫，我可以给他吃止痛药吗？
(I haven't been aware of any allergies of him. He's not on any medication that may weaken his immune system either. Can I give him pain-killers after immunization?)

30. Yes. You can get over-the-counter pain relief from any pharmacy or supermarket. Also, you can apply an ice pack to the injection area if it is bruised, red or swollen after the immunization.
(可以的。你可以在任何药店或者超市买到非处方药版的止痛药。如果在接种免疫以后，注射部位出现淤青或者红肿，你还可以用冰袋冷敷。)

31. 好的。如果接种免疫以后有什么副作用，我可以联系你们吗？
(Okay. Can I contact you if there's any side effect after immunization?)

32. Sure. If you need any medical advice, you can contact us online or give us a call.
(当然可以。如果你需要任何医疗建议，你可以在网上联系我们，或者给我们打电话。)

17. 好的，我记下来了。我需要在哪签字呢？
(Okay. I'll note it down. Where should I sign?)

33. Okay. Please tick the red or green box in the consent form, to indicate which vaccines you are consenting to, and any you are not, then sign in the space provided at the bottom.
(好的。请在同意书上面红色或者绿色的方框里面打勾，以便我们知道你同意和不同意接种哪些疫苗。然后请在底部空白处签字。)
