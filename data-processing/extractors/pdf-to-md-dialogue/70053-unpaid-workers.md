# 70053. Unpaid Workers - Legal

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place in an office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. A mandarin-speaking woman is a lodging a complaint about her employer. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, please take a seat. Tell us about your problem.
(您好，请坐吧。请说说您的问题吧。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
请坐，take a seat 要比 sit down please 礼貌很多，后者有种祈使句命令的感觉。注意在生活中的运用。

200. 你好。我和我丈夫来澳洲几个月了。我们最近做的这份工作一直没拿到工资。
(Hi. My husband and I have been in Australia for several months. We've never been paid for this recent job.)

201. What kind of work do you mean? Could you please tell me about your visa status?
(您指什么样的工作呢？你们的签证状态是什么呢？)

202. 我们要在偏远地区工作至少 88 天, 才能得到续签的资格。所以，我们做过各种各样的工作，比如在建筑公司，接待处和农场。我们拿的是打工度假签证。
(We have to work for at least 88 days in regional/remote areas to get our visa renewed. Therefore, we have done all kinds of jobs, such as in a construction firm, at the reception desk and on a farm. It's a working holiday visa.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
偏远地区：regional/remote areas
建筑公司：construction firm
在农场：on a farm

203. Could you please describe your work in detail, so we can determine the hourly payment you are entitled to?
(你可以具体讲讲你们的工作吗，这样我们可以决定你们有权拿到的时薪。)

204. 我们现在在这个地方工作大约三周了。我们和其他背包客一起在农场摘番茄, 但是老板不给我们工钱。
(We have worked at this place for around three weeks. We do tomato picking on a farm with other backpackers. But our employer hasn't paid us.)

205. Have you spoken with your employer?
(你们跟老板谈过吗？)

206. 当然啦！我的老板还很生气呢，说我们欠他的住宿费。可是我们住的那个房间很小啊！
(Of course! My employer was quite angry, and he said we owed him accommodation fee. But the room we're living in is so tiny!)

207. What's your employment status? Have you signed any contract or printed document?
(您的受雇类型是怎样的呢？您签过什么合同或者书面文件吗？)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Employment status: 受雇类型，包括：
Full time 全职
Part time 兼职
Casual 临时工

208. 我也不清楚。我们到现在为止没有签过合同，也没有见过任何书面材料。这就是我担心的原因。
(I'm not sure. We haven't signed any contracts, nor have we seen any printed documents. That's why I'm worried.)

209. Um…that doesn't sound good. You have been working in Australia for a while，so you should have some ideas about fair and reasonable work payment.
(嗯…这听上去可不太好啊。你们已经在澳大利亚工作一阵子了，所以什么样的工资报酬是公平合理的，你本该有些了解的。)

210. 我那时候也不知道我拿不到工资啊！请你帮帮我们吧！
(At that time, I didn't know that I wouldn't get paid. Please help us!)

211. We can register you and provide you with assistance. However, we will need more information to help determine what your hourly rate should be. We also need the name of the company, its location and ABN.
(我们可以把你的案子登记在案，然后给你提供些帮助。不过，我们还需要更多信息，才能决定你的时薪。我们还需要你所在公司的名字，地址和澳大利亚商业号。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
ABN：Australian Business Number 澳大利亚商业号(CCL 必考词汇)
TFN： Tax File Number 税号 (CCL 必考词汇)

212. 我不知道这些信息啊！我老板没有告诉过我。但是我会找到这些信息的。谢谢你的帮助。
(I have no idea of all these. My employer has never told me about it. But I'll try to find them out. Thank you for your help.)

213. You're welcome. I still need you to fill out some forms and get back to me.
(不客气。我还需要你把这些表填了，再回来找我。)
