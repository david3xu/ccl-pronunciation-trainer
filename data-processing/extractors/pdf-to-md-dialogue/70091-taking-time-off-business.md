# 70091. Taking time off - Business

**Briefing:** This conversation is between a Mandarin-speaking employee and an English-speaking employer, called Jenny. The employee wants to take some time off work because her son is participating a running race. The dialogue takes place in the manager's office.

1. Hi，I received your email saying that you wanted to see me. How can I help you?
(你好。我刚收到你的邮件说你想见我。我今天能如何帮到您呢？)

2. 你好，珍妮。谢谢你能见我。我想下个月请一段时间的假。
(Hello, Jenny. Thank you for meeting me. I want to take some time off next month.)

3. I see，we are very busy at the moment and it's such short notice. Could you tell me why you need some time off?
(我知道了。目前我们挺忙的，而且你提出来得太急了。你能告诉我你为什么想要请一段时间的假吗？)

4. 我儿子参加了一个跑步比赛。这个比赛很重要，他进入了决赛，我想要去看他跑步。
(My son is in a running race, a quite big one. He's in the final and I want to be there for him.)

5. It sounds like a really exciting opportunity! You must be very proud of him! Could you tell me how long you need?
(听起来真的是个很激动人心的机会啊！你一定很为他骄傲吧！你能告诉我你要请多久的假吗？)

6. 他很激动，我们也是！我想要请一周的假，下个月 2-9 号。
(He's very excited, so are we! I want to take one week off, from the second to the ninth of next month.)

7. It' s quite difficult. We are short of staff currently, and I'll have to cover your shifts.
(不太好办。我们目前正缺人手，我得找人替你的班。)

8. 我明白。我们也是上周才知道他进了决赛的。他自己也没想到。不过他确实进步很快。
(I see. We didn't know that he's in the final until last week. He didn't see that coming either. He is improving quickly though.)

9. I may have to see if I can find some casual workers to cover your shifts. I'll also call the employment agency to see if anyone is available.
(我可能得看看我能不能找到一些临时工来替你的班。我再给职业中介打个电话，看看能不能找到人。)

10. 我知道同部门的两个临时工想要多工作几个小时。他们也许可以帮忙。
(I know that two casual workers in my department would like to work extra hours. Maybe they can help.)

11. That's good. I will talk to them. Have you filled in the leave request form yet?
(那可以。我会找他们谈的。你填请假申请表了吗？)

12. 没有，我还没填呢。我想先问问你，如果可以的话，我再填表。
(No, not yet. I wanted to ask you first and if it's okay, I'll do it then.)

13. It's ok with me. It's very short notice, but I'm sure we'll find a way to work it out. You can fill in the form and get back to me, so I can approve them.
(我这边没问题的。你提出来的比较急，但是我相信我们能找到办法解决的。你可以把表填了再来找我，我就可以批准了。)

14. 谢谢你，珍妮。谢谢你的理解。对于我来说，为儿子加油很重要。
(Thank you, Jenny. Thanks for your understanding. It's important for me to be there and cheer for my son.)
