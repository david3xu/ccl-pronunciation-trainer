#70040. Centrelink Enquiry - Social welfare

1.
Good morning. Welcome to Centrelink. What can I do for you today?
早上好。欢迎来到社会福利联络中心。我今天能为你做些什么呢？

2.
你好，我想问问我是否有资格领取什么补助金。
Hi. I want to ask if I'm eligible for any benefits.

3.
Okay. Could you describe your detailed situation, so I can check the benefits you may be eligible for?
好的。你可以详细描述一下你的情况吗？这样我可以看看你可能有资格申请到哪些补助金。

4.
我丈夫两个星期前在一次车祸中受了重伤。他有几个月都不能工作了。
My husband was severely injured in a car accident two weeks ago. He won't be able to work for months.

5.
Could you describe what's exactly wrong with your husband? Have you brought any letters or certificates from the doctor that can describe his injury?
你可以描述一下你丈夫到底发生了什么吗？你有没有能描述他伤情的医生证明或信件呢？

6.
有的。证明在这里。他浑身多处受伤。最严重的是他右腿的大腿骨折了。
Yes. Here's the certificate. He suffered multiple injuries all over his body. The most severe one is the fracture in his right thigh.

7.
I see. Yes, this is complicated now. Is he the sole income earner in your family or do you work?
我了解了。嗯，现在这情况很复杂了。他是你们家里收入的唯一来源吗？还是你也工作呢？

8.
没有，我不工作，因为我们有三个孩子，而且托儿服务也是很贵的。我丈夫是临时工，所以他生病了是没有收入的，也没有带薪病假。
No, I don't work because we have three kids and child care is also quite expensive. My husband is a casual worker, so he won't get paid or have any paid sick leave when he's sick.

9.
So you don't have any incomes now. I can see you are on family tax benefit for your children, so you're already in our system.
所以你们现在没有任何收入了。我看到你们正在领取给孩子的家庭税收福利金，所以你们已经在我们的系统里了。

10.
是的。我们一直在靠积蓄生活。但是我们没有很多钱。我丈夫出院以后，什么事情都是我在料理。
Yes. We have been living on our savings, but we don't have much money. I have been taking care of everything since my husband was discharged.

11.
You are indeed in financial hardship then. It must be very difficult for you.
那你们确实是有经济困难的。这对你们来说一定很难啊。

12.
是的。尤其是我们在这边没有家人。今天是我邻居在照顾我丈夫和三个孩子，所以我才能抽空来这的。
Yes, especially when we don't have any family here. My neighbor is taking care of my husband and the three kids today so I could have time to be here.

13.
You may meet our eligibility criteria for some benefits, but you need to fill in some forms and upload some documents online first.
你可能符合一些补助金的资格，但是你需要先填一些表格，以及在网上传一些文件。

14.
我想我做不到。我的英语不是很好。
I don't think I can do that. My English is not very good.

15.
We have interpreter service that can help you. Here're the details and you can contact them straightforwardly.
我们有可以帮助你的口译服务。这里是详细信息，你可以直接联系他们。

16.
谢谢你的帮助。你人真好。我会尽快递交申请表的。
Thank you for your help. It's really nice of you. I'll submit the application form as soon as possible.
