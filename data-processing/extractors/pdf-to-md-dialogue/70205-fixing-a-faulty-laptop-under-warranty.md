#70205. Fixing a Faulty Laptop Under Warranty - Business

1.
Hi there! Thanks for stopping by our computer shop. What can I do for you today?
你好，欢迎光临我们的电脑店。请问今天有什么我能帮忙的吗？

2.
你好，我今天不是来买东西的。我的笔记本电脑出了点毛病。
Hi, I'm not here to buy anything today. My laptop's having some issues.

3.
That's totally fine. We offer diagnostics and repair services here. I'll definitely see what I can do for you.
没问题，我们这边有提供检查和维修服务。我肯定可以帮你看看。

4.
我把笔记本带过来了，是在你们店买的，可是它最近总是出问题，搞得我很头大。
I brought my laptop with me. I bought it from your store, but lately it keeps having problems. It's really frustrating.

5.
Got it. Good thing you brought it in. Did you happen to bring the receipt and the warranty card?
明白了，您带过来就对了。您带发票和保修卡了吗？

6.
有的，小票我带了，电脑也还在质保期。这台电脑，我买到现在还不到一年呢。
Yeah, I brought the receipt. It's still under warranty. I bought this computer less than a year ago.

7.
I see. Since it's still under warranty, it really shouldn't be having problems this early. It's a solid model.
了解，既然还在保修期，按理说不该这么快出问题。这款型号的电脑不错的。

8.
刚买的时候都还好，我很满意的。但是用了两三个星期之后，它就开始发烫了，我不得不关机。它还会开始随意自动关机。
It worked fine at first, and I was very happy with it. But after 2-3 weeks, it started getting too hot, so I had to turn it off. It even began shutting down by itself randomly.

9.
Yeah, laptops do get warm, depending on what you're doing, and your room temperature, but they shouldn't be overheating.
明白。笔记本在使用过程中会发热，跟工作内容和室温有关，但不该这么烫的。

10.
我用这个电脑处理商务文件的。无论什么资料，处理的时候都会丢失。这事搞得我很烦，我也不知道是哪出了问题。
I use this computer for business documents. Every time I work on files with it, they get lost. This is driving me crazy, and I can't figure out what's wrong.

11.
Oh, no! It might be a busted fan, a battery issue, or something on the software side. I'll have to take a look to know for sure.
哎呀！可能是风扇坏了，可能是电池问题，也可能是软件方面的故障。我得检查一下才能确定。

12.
那我是不是得把电脑放在这？我已经把文件都备份好了，我就是怕修电脑的时候资料会丢。
So I need to leave the laptop here, right? I've backed up everything already—I'm just worried something might get lost during the repair.

13.
Great. Yup, just leave it here with me. Once I figure out what's wrong, I'll give you a call.
太好了。对，把电脑留到我这就行，我找到问题就给你打电话。

14.
谢谢你啦，希望只是小毛病，我可不想再折腾一次啦。
Thanks, I really hope it's nothing serious. I really don't want to go through this hassle again.
