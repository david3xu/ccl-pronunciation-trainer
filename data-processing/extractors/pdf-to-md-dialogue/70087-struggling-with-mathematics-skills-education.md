# 70087. Struggling with mathematics skills - Education

**Briefing:** The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking school teacher and a mandarin-speaking mother. They are discussing the mathematics skills of the mother's daughter. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hi. My name is Sally. I am your daughter's teacher. It's very nice to meet you.
(你好，我是莎莉。我是你女儿的老师。很高兴见到你。)

2. 你好，莎莉，很高兴見到你。我有点担心你为什么要见我呢?
(Hello, Sally. It's nice to meet you. I'm a bit worried about why you asked to see me.)

3. Nothing bad. Your daughter settled in quite well. I just want to talk with you about her mathematics skills. She seems to be struggling in this area.
(没什么坏事。你的女儿适应得挺好的。我就是想跟你谈谈她的数学能力。她在这方面似乎有些困难。)

4. 好的，原来是这样。我知道她不喜欢数学。每天晚上，她总是把数学作业放到最后才做。我没意识到数学对她来说这么难。
(Okay, I see. I know that she's not keen on math. She always leaves her math homework to the last minute every evening. I didn't realize that math is so difficult for her.)

5. Knowing that she is not keen on math will not help. I want to talk with you to see if we can find a way to give her some extra support.
(知道她不喜欢数学这一点，对她并没有帮助。我想跟你聊聊，看看能不能找到办法来多帮帮她。)

6. 我愿意尽我所能去帮她。我知道数学对她是非常重要的。我也不希望她落后于班上其他同学。
(I'd love to try my best to help her. I know that math is very important to her and I also don't want her to fall behind her classmates.)

7. It will be helpful if you can sit with her every night and supervise her homework. We will arrange a teacher's aide, 1 on 1 during the class for her.
(如果您可以每个晚上陪她一起坐下来，看着她写作业，就可以帮到她。我们会安排一个教学助理，在课上一对一地帮助她。)

8. 听起来真好，莎莉。我會尽力帮她的。但是我的数学也不怎么好啊。
(That sounds really good, Sally. I'll try my best to help her. But I'm not really good at math either.)

9. Don't worry. I am sure you will be fine at that level. She will improve quickly with such extra help.
(别担心。那个程度的数学你肯定没问题的。有了额外的帮助，她会进步得很快的。)

10. 太棒了，你觉得她是否需要课后辅导吗? 我知道学校的其他小朋友都有请家教。
(That's great. Do you think she needs after-school tutoring? I know that all the other kids at school have tutors.)

11. I don't think she needs that yet. We will review her progress a few months later, and then make a decision. She is certainly doing well in other subjects.
(我觉得她还不需要。我们过几个月再看一下她的进度，然后再定吧。她其他的科目都很不错的。)

12. 这听起来是个不错的计划。非常感谢你莎莉，我真的很感激。
(That sounds like a good plan. Thank you very much Sally. I really appreciate it.)
