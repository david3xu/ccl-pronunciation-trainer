#70238. Ordering Oat Milk in a Small Town - Business

1.
Hi, it's nice to see you. I hope you've settled in! Living in a small town must be a big change. Have you gotten used to the quieter pace yet?
嗨，很高兴见到你。希望你已经安顿好了！住在这么小的镇上肯定是大变化。你适应了这种更悠闲的节奏了吗？

2.
你好！是的，我从来没住过这么小的地方，而且这儿离城里又很远。不过邻居们都特别热情。
Hello, yes, I've never lived in such a small place, and it's quite a distance from the city. But the neighbours have been really welcoming.

3.
It is. It takes a while to get to the city and a while to get used to everything here. I hope the sense of community can make up for it.
确实，去城里要花点时间，这里的生活节奏也要慢慢适应。我希望这里的社区氛围能弥补这些不便。

4.
对，我发现小镇上的人都很友好，我通过工作，已经认识了大半个镇上的人。这种亲切感在大城市里可体验不到。
Yes, I've found that people in this town are very friendly, and through work I've already met most of them. You'd never get that kind of warmth in a big city!

5.
Everyone got excited when the new doctor arrived. The previous doctor moved back to the city, and it took a long time before the replacement showed up.
新的医生一来大家都很兴奋。之前的医生搬回城里，换医生又等了好一阵子。

6.
我现在不打算搬回城里，但是，我确实很想念城里的东西，尤其是那些商店。想买什么都能在一个商场里搞定。
I'm not planning to move back to the city, but I do miss city amenities, especially those shops. You could get everything in one shopping centre.

7.
I understand. I can order some grocery items for you from my suppliers if they're things you buy regularly but we don't have them in stock.
我明白。如果你经常买的日用品我们没有库存，我可以帮你从我供应商那里订购。

8.
太好了，我都不知道你可以这样做，我有过敏，所以我更喜欢喝燕麦奶。但是现在快喝完了。
Great, I didn't realize you could do that. I have allergies, so I prefer oat milk. But mine's almost gone.

9.
Okay, most people in this town buy dairy or soy milk, so I have them in stock. But I think I can order oat milk for you from my supplier.
好的，这里大多数人喝乳制品或豆奶，所以这些都有货。不过我想我可以从我供应商那里给你订燕麦奶。

10.
太好了。如果可以的话，我一周需要消耗两升燕麦奶。我通常会每两周购买一次。
Great. If possible, I use about two litres of oat milk per week. I usually buy it every two weeks.

11.
That should be fine. I restock every one to two weeks, so I'll make sure to order enough. I'll see if I can have your oat milk delivered along with my other goods.
应该没问题。我每一到两周补货一次，所以我会确保订够量的。我会看看能不能把你的燕麦奶和我的其他货一起送来。

12.
太感谢了，真的谢谢你。说不定你订了燕麦奶以后，镇上其他人也会跟着买呢。
Thanks so much, I really appreciate it. If you order oat milk, maybe other people in the town will buy it too.

13.
You never know. I'm happy to help. If you order yourself, the delivery fee will be very high, but I can get it cheaper for you.
谁知道呢。我很乐意帮忙。如果你自己下单，运费会很贵，但我可以帮你拿到更便宜的价格。

14.
感谢你！我发现，小镇上的人们都很团结互助，这是住在这里最美好的事情之一。
Thank you! I've found that people in this town really stick together. This is one of the best things about living here.
