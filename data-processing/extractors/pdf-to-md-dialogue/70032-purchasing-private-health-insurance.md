#70032. Purchasing Private Health Insurance - Business

1.
Good morning. I'm Grace. How can I help you today?
早上好，我是格雷斯。今天我能怎么帮助您呢？

2.
早上好。我想购买私人医疗保险，来作为国民医保的补充。我想了解一下你们公司的产品。
Good morning. I want to purchase private health insurance as a top up of Medicare. I would like to learn about your company's products.

3.
I'm glad to help you. Our policies range with different prices, so that you can choose the one that best suits your needs. Are you purchasing for yourself or your family?
很高兴帮助您。我们有不同价格区间的各类保单，您可以选择一种最符合您需求的。您是给自己买，还是给家人买呢？

4.
哦，我是给我家人一起买的。我家有四个孩子，还有我和我老婆，可以说是一大家子人了。是不是会很贵啊？
Well, it's for my family. It's for my four children, my wife and me. You can say we are a big family. Will it be expensive?

5.
Well, our policies and premiums are the same for all families, regardless of how many children you have.
不管家里有几个孩子，我们的保单和保险费对于所有家庭都是一样的。

6.
这也太棒了啊！那救护车呢？我听说澳大利亚的救护车很贵，叫一次就要好几千澳币。你们保险可以报销救护车吗？
That's amazing! What about the ambulance? I heard it's very expensive in Australia and it would cost a few thousand dollars for one emergency visit. Does your insurance cover the ambulance?

7.
Well, you might like to choose our Gold Extra Insurance. It can fully cover the cost of ambulance if it was for genuine medical situations. It also covers private hospital fees, dental and optometry.
你可以选择我们黄金级别的额外保险。如果是真实的医疗情况，这个保险可以全额报销救护车费用。这个保险还能报销私人医院，看牙和验光的费用。

8.
好的，我知道了。如果不是非要叫救护车，我们当然也不会使用救护车服务啊。至于私人医院就不需要了。我听说公立医院跟私立一样好。
Okay. I see. We certainly won't call the ambulance unless we have to. As for the private hospital, we don't need it. I heard the public hospitals are as good as private ones.

9.
Okay. Please fill in these forms to sign up for our premium service.
好的，麻烦您填写这些表格，就可以注册享受我们优质的服务了。

谢谢，不过我还得先回家跟我老婆商量一下。要不然她会说我的。谢谢你的帮助。
Thank you, but I need to discuss with my wife first when I'm home. Otherwise she'll nag me. Thank you for your help.
