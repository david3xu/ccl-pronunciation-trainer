#70012. Pregnancy Check-up - Medical

1.
Hello, Mrs. Wen. I haven't seen you for a while. Do you feel unwell?
温太太你好。我有阵子没见到你啦。你不舒服吗？

2.
你好，医生。我今天来是因为我怀孕了。我想问一些关于怀孕的注意事项。
Hello, doctor. I'm here today because I'm pregnant. I'd like to know the do's and don'ts.

3.
Congratulations! Well, there are some things you need to take note of. First, do you smoke or drink?
恭喜你！确实有些事是你需要注意的。首先，你抽烟或者喝酒吗？

4.
我从来不抽烟。我一般也不喝酒。不过我和朋友出去的时候，会喝一些红酒。
I never smoke. I usually don't drink either, but I'll have some red wine when I hang out with friends.

5.
Considering the link between alcohol and some serious diseases in babies, I advise you not to drink alcohol at all during your pregnancy.
考虑到酒精和宝宝得的一些严重疾病的关连，我建议你在怀孕期间完全不要喝酒啦。

6.
好的，这我能做到。我听说怀孕的时候要尽量少吃海鲜，这是为什么呢？
Okay. I can do that. I heard that pregnant women should eat less sea food. Why?

7.
Seafood can contain a lot of heavy metals that can harm your baby's development. You should also eat a lot of healthy foods, including fresh vegetables, fruits, meat, grains, and dairy products.
海鲜会包含很多重金属，这会伤害到宝宝的发育。你应该多吃健康食物，包括新鲜蔬菜，水果，肉，谷类和乳制品。

8.
好的。我有一个朋友说，在她怀孕的时候，她每天都会吃很多维生素，来补充钙和铁。
Okay. A friend of mine said that she would have a lot of vitamins as supplements to calcium and iron during her pregnancy.

9.
Yes. And you should also do some exercises during your pregnancy. Do you do physical activity?
是的。怀孕期间，你还应该做些锻炼。你平常运动吗？

10.
我平时会打羽毛球。但是因为我怀孕了，我准备暂时先不打。
I usually play badminton, but I plan to put if off because of the pregnancy.

11.
You can still play badminton at your first three to four months. After that, I suggest you try to avoid activities that require significant balance and coordination.
在你怀孕的前3到4个月，你还是可以打羽毛球的。在那之后，我建议你尽量避免做需要很大平衡和协调能力的运动。

12.
好的。那我就做一些游泳或者散步这样的轻微运动吧。非常感谢您！
Okay. Then I'll do some mild/light exercise like swimming or strolling. Thank you very much.
