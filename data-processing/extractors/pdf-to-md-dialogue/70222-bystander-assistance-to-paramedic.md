#70222. Bystander Assistance to Paramedic - Medical

1.
Hi there, I'm one of the paramedics. You said you made the call earlier. Can you walk me through what happened?
你好，我是其中一位急救人员。你说刚才是你打的电话。你能给我详细说说发生了什么吗？

2.
你好，这位男士刚才就在我面前突然倒下了，我看到他晕倒在地上了。
Hi. Just now, this man suddenly collapsed right in front of me. I saw him faint on the ground.

3.
Do you know how long he's been unconscious? Did you see any warning signs before he went down?
你知道他昏迷多久了吗？他倒下前，有没有表现出任何预兆？

4.
有两分钟左右了。倒下之前，他有点站不稳，脸色也很苍白。
About two minutes. Before he collapsed, he was a bit unsteady and looked very pale.

5.
Got it, thanks for the heads-up. I'm going to check his pulse and breathing right away.
明白，多谢告知。我现在马上检查他的脉搏和呼吸情况。

6.
这像是心脏病发作了？我还能帮上什么忙吗？比如找药什么的？
Is this a heart attack? What else can I do to help, like look for medication?

7.
I'm not certain yet. Please stay calm and move back a bit so I have room to work.
现在还不确定。请保持冷静，后退一点儿，好让我有空间操作。

8.
没问题。我往后退一点。我刚给打电话叫了救护车。救护车还有多久到？
No problem, I'll step back. I just called an ambulance. How long does it take for the ambulance to arrive?

9.
The ambulance is minutes away. Right now, I'm looking for any injuries from the fall, especially around his head and spine.
救护车几分钟就到。我现在在检查他的摔伤情况，特别是头部和脊椎附近。

10.
我刚才好像看到他头部撞到地了。需要在他脑袋下面，垫点软的东西吗？
I think I saw his head hit the ground just now. Should we put something soft under his head?

11.
It's better to leave him as he is for now, until we assess him properly. Moving him may cause further injury.
在我们好好检查他之前，最好先让他保持现状。动他可能会让他伤得更严重。

12.
明白，我不碰他。真希望他能快些恢复。大家也别慌啊！
Understood. I won't touch him. I really hope he recovers soon. Everyone stays calm!

13.
You did well by calling for help. The ambulance is almost here, and they will take over.
你打电话求助，做得很好。救护队快到了，他们会接手处理的。

14.
好的，我会保持镇定的。咱们确保，这块地方在救护车来的时候，是畅通的。
Okay, I'll stay calm. Let's make sure the area is clear for the ambulance when it arrives.
