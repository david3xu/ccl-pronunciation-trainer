# 70055. Carer Allowance – Social Welfare

Briefing：The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking Centrelink officer and a mandarin speaking woman, whose husband has severe senile dementia. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning! How can I help you?  
(早上好，我能如何帮到您呢？)

2. 早上好, 医生建议我来咨询一下我丈夫的事情。  
(Good morning. The doctor suggested that I should come here and make some enquiries about my husband.)

3. I see. Please talk to me about your husband's problems these days, if you don't mind.  
(原来是这样/我了解了。如果您不介意的话，请您跟我说说您丈夫目前的问题吧。)

4. 医生说，我丈夫的老年痴呆最近越来越严重了。我觉得靠我自己一个人照顾他，越来越困难了。  
(According to the doctor, my husband's senile dementia has been getting worse and worse recently. I think it's been more and more difficult to take care of him all by myself.)

5. That must be very difficult for you. Could you please tell me about your current financial situation?  
(您一定很辛苦吧！您可以跟我说下你们现在的经济状况吗？)

6. 我和我丈夫现在靠养老金生活。不过，至少我们现在住的房子是我们自己的。所以日子过得没有其他人那么差。  
(My husband and I are living off our age pension. But at least we live in our own place, so life is not as bad as others'.)

Live off something/someone 靠…生活

7. It's good to know. Do you have other family members to help you with his day to day care?  
(那挺好的。你有其他的家人可以帮你日常护理你丈夫吗？)

8. 没有人了。我的孩子们都在城里工作，他们的孩子们周末有各种各样的活动要参加，所以他们没工夫来看我。  
(No. All my kids work downtown, and their kids have all kinds of activities to attend during weekends. So they don't have time to visit me.)

9. I totally understand. We can help you to apply for Carer Allowance. You might also want to contact Carers Australia to see if they can give you any extra support.  
(我完全理解。我们可以帮您申请照顾者津贴。你或许还可以联系澳大利亚照顾者协会，看看那边能不能给您提供更多的帮助。)

10. 我从来没听说过这个澳大利亚照顾者协会啊。他们是干什么的啊？  
(I have never heard of this "Carers Australia". What do they do?)

11. It is an organization that provides support and information to people like you as a carer. You might find them helpful to you in your carer role.  
(这是一个给像您这样的照顾者提供帮助和信息的机构。作为照顾者，您可能会觉得他们有帮助。)

12. 有帮手我当然是很乐意的。他们都能帮我做什么呢？再像这样下去，我就要撑不住了。  
(I would definitely be happy with a helper. What help could they offer?/ What can they help me with? I can't hold on anymore if things continue like this.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
撑住：hold on；  
Hold on 还有稍等的意思。

13. They may help you find someone to look after your husband once a week, or on a whole weekend to help give you a break.  
(他们或许能帮您找人每周照顾您丈夫一次，或者整个周末都帮忙照顾您丈夫，来让您休息一下。)

14. 可算救我一命。我现在可远不能和我年轻的时候比了。每天从早到晚的事耗尽了我所有的时间和精力。  
(That's a life saver. I'm way not who I was when I was younger. All my time and energy have been consumed by doing chores all day long.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
"我现在可远不能和我年轻的时候比了"不能翻成"I can't compare myself to who I was when I was younger"  可以翻译为"I'm not who I was when I was younger.""I'm not who I used to be when I was younger."或者"I'm no longer the person I used to be."

15. Here are the contact details and an application form for Carers Australia.  
(这里是澳大利亚照顾者协会的联系方式和申请表。)

16. 好的，我会尽快填写好, 递交申请表的。非常感谢你的帮助。  
(OK. I'll fill in the application form and submit it as soon as possible. Thank you very much for your help.)
