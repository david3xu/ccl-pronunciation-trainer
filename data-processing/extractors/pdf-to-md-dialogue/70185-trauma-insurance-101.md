#70185. Trauma Insurance 101 - Business

1.
Good morning. I didn't expect to hear from you again so soon. I hope everything's alright.
早上好！没想到这么快又收到你的电话，希望一切都顺利。

2.
早上好！谢谢你，一切都挺好的。我知道我们两周前才刚见过面，不过我现在有些保险相关的事情想请你帮忙。
Good morning! Thanks, everything's going well. I know we just met two weeks ago, but I need your help with some insurance matters.

3.
No problem. Are you looking to adjust your current policy or switch to a different type?
没问题！你是想调整现有的保单，还是换一种不同的保险产品？

4.
我最近正在考虑一种新的保险。我一直在网上查询有关创伤保险的信息。我想要进一步了解一下。
I've been looking into a new type of insurance lately. I've been researching trauma insurance online, and I'd like to learn more about it.

5.
Sure! We're more than happy to help with that. I'd be happy to answer all your questions, and I can also give you a quote based on your needs.
当然！我们很乐意帮忙。我可以解答你的所有问题，也可以根据你的需求给你一个报价。

6.
谢谢你！我想知道创伤保险是不是谁都能买？有没有什么限制？
Thanks! I'd like to know—can anyone purchase trauma insurance, or are there any restrictions?

7.
Well, trauma insurance generally excludes pre-existing conditions. So, if you already have any pre-existing conditions covered by your current policy, that particular condition won't be covered under trauma insurance.
嗯，创伤保险一般不保既往病。所以，如果你有什么既往病，现保单也承保，那创伤保险里不会赔付的。

8.
有道理。我现在没有健康问题。但是以后的事情谁知道呢？这个保险能覆盖所有的疾病吗？
That makes sense. I don't have any health issues right now, but who knows what could happen in the future? Does this insurance cover all illnesses?

9.
Trauma insurance coverage is similar to that of other critical illness policies. It usually includes six major categories, such as heart attacks.
创伤保险的保障范围和其他重疾险类似，通常涵盖六大类病症，比如心脏病发作。

10.
你也知道，我现在还有一些债要还。如果以后生病了，可能就没办法继续还款了。所以我觉得这个保险可能是个不错的选择。
You know, I still have some debts to pay off. If I get sick in the future, I might not be able to keep up with the payments. So, I think this insurance could be a good option.

11.
Why don't I give you a few quotes? We can discuss your options and see which one is right for you.
要不我给你一些报价？我们可以讨论讨论你都有哪些选择，看看哪种方案最适合你。

12.
这个计划听起来不错。你可以给我报价的所有信息吗？
That sounds like a good plan. Can you send me all the details of the quotes?

13.
I'll send you a form to fill in. I also need to get some medical information from you to get a quote for this type of insurance.
我会给你发个表格填写。我还需要收集一些你的健康信息才能给这种保险报价。

14.
好的，没问题。我会尽快填好并寄回给你。
Alright, no problem. I'll fill it out as soon as possible and send it back to you.
