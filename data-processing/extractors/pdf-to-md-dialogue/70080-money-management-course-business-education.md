# 70080. Money Management Course - Business+Education

**Briefing:** The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking new arrival and an English-speaking director, who runs courses to help people manage their money and budget. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hi, my name is Max. How can I help you today?
(您好，我是麦克斯。我今天能如何帮到您呢？)

2. 你好,麦克斯。我看见通知上写，这里有教怎么管理金钱的课程。
(Hello, Max. I saw on the notice that there are courses here that teach people how to manage their money.)

3. Yes. You could sign up for the course now. Besides, it won't cost you any money to attend it. We run the courses here at the community center.
(是的。您现在就可以报名的。另外，您报名也不用花钱的。我们是在社区中心开课的。)

4. 原来是免费的，太好了！但是，我担心我的英语不够好。不能上这个课。
(Turns out it's free! That's great! But I do have a concern that my English is not good enough for this course.)

5. That won't be a problem. Our class is facing to all people will all English levels. And our teachers are very patient. They understand that some students might need some extra help.
(这不成问题的。我们的课程是面向所有英文程度的学员的。我们的老师都非常有耐心。他们知道有些学生可能需要一些额外的帮助。)

6. 太好啦。那这个课程包括什么呢？我想多学一些关于管理预算的内容。但是我没有很多钱。我现在只是在兼职工作。
(That's great. What does this class include? I want to learn more about how to manage my budget. However, I don't have much money. I'm only working part time now.)

7. Our class will teach you how to organize your budget and follow your budget. You can save money every week.
(我们的课程会教你怎么管理和遵循预算。每周你都能攒下来钱的。)

8. 也许人们已经知道管理金钱很重要了。但是，澳大利亚的消费比我想象中的要高很多啊。
(Perhaps people already know that it's important to save money. However, the level of spending/consumption in Australia is much higher than I imagined.)

9. Many people need to have some basic knowledge about managing money. Creating budget is very important. You'll find that you are not the only people who have this concern. That's the reason why we organize this course.
(很多人是需要有一些基础的理财知识的。有个预算是非常重要的。你会发现，不止你一个人有这个担忧。这也是我们组织这个课程的原因。)

10. 这样听起来放心多了。我想存钱买车。这样可以为我的工作节省很多时间。我希望这个课程可以帮我实现我的愿望。
(I'm much relieved to hear that. I want to save up for a car so that I can save a lot of time for work. I hope this course can help me achieve my goal/get what I want.)

11. I'm sure this course will help you reach your goal. Now please write your name and telephone number on this list. We are looking forward to seeing you when the course commences.
(我相信这个课程可以帮你实现你的目标的。现在，麻烦你在单子上填一下你的名字和电话号码。希望开课以后早点见到你呀。)

12. 谢谢你了。找到适合的课程真的很难。尤其是对于我这种刚来澳大利亚的新移民。你真的有帮到我，而且你人很好！
(Thank you. It's really hard to find a suitable course, especially for newly arrived migrants like me. You have been really helpful and kind.)
