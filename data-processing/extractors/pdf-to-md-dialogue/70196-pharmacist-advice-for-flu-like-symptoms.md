#70196. Pharmacist Advice for Flu-Like Symptoms - Medical

1.
Hi, you seem a bit under the weather. What can I do for you?
嗨，你看上去好像身体不太舒服。有什么我能帮忙的吗？

2.
是呀。我很难受。我女儿大概从一周前就开始咳嗽了，现在我也咳嗽起来了，我感觉我好像也感染了同一种病毒。
Yes, I feel unwell. About a week ago, my daughter started coughing, and now I'm coughing too. I feel like I've caught the same virus.

3.
Oh dear, there's quite a potent virus circulating these days, and many people have already been hit by it.
哎呀，最近有一种很厉害的病毒在传播，已经影响到很多人了。

4.
医生说我女儿不用吃药，只要呆在家休息，不去上学就行。她现在已经恢复了，不过我病得比她严重，感觉特别难受。
The doctor said my daughter doesn't need any medication and should just stay home instead of going to school. She's recovered now, but I'm much sicker than her and feel really awful.

5.
Well, kids usually bounce back from viral infections more quickly than adults. I'm sorry you've caught it too. It's quite unfortunate. This virus can be quite contagious.
孩子通常比大人更快从病毒感染中恢复。很遗憾你也感染了。太不幸了。这个病毒传染性很强。

6.
没错，这病毒的传染性实在是太强了。你能不能帮我开点药，让我感觉好一点呢？
Yeah, this virus is so contagious. Could you prescribe some medication to help me feel a bit better?

7.
Unfortunately, no medicine can cure a viral infection outright. The virus usually has to run its course while your body heals on its own, which can take a while.
遗憾的是，没有任何药物能直接治愈病毒感染。通常病毒需要靠你身体自己恢复，这可能得花一段时间。

8.
我感觉是实在太糟了，全身酸痛，就连躺在床上也觉得疼。而且，我还发烧了。
I feel really terrible; my whole body aches and even lying in bed is painful. I also have a fever.

9.
I understand. Although I can't directly prescribe medicine here, I can definitely recommend some over-the-counter options that may help lower your fever and let you sleep better.
我明白。虽然我不能直接给你开药，但我完全可以推荐一些非处方药，它们可能可以帮你退烧，让你睡得更好些。

10.
太好了，发烧真是太难熬了。一开始我觉得特别冷，接着出了好多汗，热得要命。而且我的喉咙也很痛。刀割一样疼。
That's great, having a fever is really awful. At first, I felt really cold, and then I broke out in a heavy sweat. It was unbearably hot. Plus, my throat is hurting so badly, it feels like it's being sliced with a knife.

11.
You might try some throat lozenges that might ease your sore throat. You could also try some steam inhalation, which can help soothe your cough.
你可以试试含点含片，可能会缓解你的喉咙痛。你也可以试试吸蒸汽，有助于缓解咳嗽。

12.
好的，我试试。非常感谢你。我真希望我能快点好，我不能一直待在家里，耽误上班了。
Alright, I'll give that a try. Thanks a lot. I really hope I can get better soon. I can't keep staying home and missing work.

13.
Yes, while the medicine won't tackle the virus itself, it should definitely help with the symptoms. I hope you feel better soon and can get back to work.
是的，虽然药物不能直接治好病毒，但肯定能缓解你的症状。希望你快点好起来，能回去上班。

14.
非常感谢你的帮助。生病真是太麻烦了，总让人觉得特别难受，我真心希望能尽快恢复正常。
Thank you so much for your help. Being sick is such a hassle. It always makes you feel terrible. I truly hope to get back to normal as soon as possible.
