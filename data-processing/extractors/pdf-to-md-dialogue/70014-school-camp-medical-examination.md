#70014. School Camp Medical Examination - Education

1.
Good morning, Mr. Jin. You want to talk about your son's medical form, right?
金先生早啊。您想谈谈你儿子的体检表是吗？

2.
早上好，医生。我儿子西蒙要参加学校的野营活动。他把这个健康表格拿回家了，说学校老师说，按照惯例，要找医生填写才能去野营。
Good morning doctor. Simon, my son, is going to his school camp. He took this medical form home and said the teacher told him that, as usual, the form should be filled in by a doctor before he could go to the camp.

3.
Yes, the form does look familiar. Before filling out the form, I need to know your son's medical history, including allergies if there's any.
是的。这个表格看上去确实很眼熟。在填表之前，我需要了解下你儿子的病史，如果有过敏史的话也请提供吧。

4.
这张表格看上去真复杂啊，看得我头疼。您能跟我说说这上面都问了什么问题吗？我儿子需要体检吗？
This form looks so complicated. It gives me headaches. Could you tell me what it says? Does my son need a body check?

5.
Let's first look at the first section of the form. It is about his allergy and immunization record such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus and polio.
我们先看下表格的第一部分。这个是关于你儿子的过敏史和接种免疫记录的，比如说麻疹，腮腺炎，风疹，破伤风和小儿麻痹。

6.
我儿子接种疫苗的全部记录我们都保留着呢。您说的这些他都接种过。他小时候对青霉素过敏。这一点需要告诉学校吗？
We still have all my son's immunization records. He has been immunized against all these diseases that you have mentioned. He was allergic to penicillin when he was little. Do I need to let the school know about this?

7.
If it isn't mentioned in the medical form, then it's not necessary for you to notify the school. As long as the school is aware of this allergy, it won't affect your son's going to the camp.
如果体检表格上没说，你就没必要通知学校了。只要学校对他的过敏情况知情，你儿子去野营就不会受影响。

8.
那就好，我儿子可盼望去野营了。对了，他前几天吃了海鲜胃不舒服，还拉肚子了。不过我感觉这个像食物中毒而不是过敏吧。
That's great. My son is keen to go camping. It just occurred to me that he got an upset stomach after having seafood several days ago and he also got diarrhea/got loose bowels/got loose stools. However, I feel that's more like food poisoning instead of allergy.

9.
That sounds right. The next section is about whether he has taken cholesterol, heartbeat and blood tests. Has he taken these tests before?
听起来是这样的。表格的下一部分是关于他有没有测过胆固醇，心率和验血。这些之前他验过吗？

10.
没有，那我就带他去做检查吧。最后这一栏，是让我在上面签字是吗？
No. I'll take him to do those tests then. As for the last column，I should sign it, right?

11.
That's correct. This is a medical treatment consent form. It will authorize the teachers in charge at the camp to take any necessary medical procedures in the case of emergency, provided that they can't contact you.
是的。这是个治疗同意书。有紧急情况发生时，如果联系不上你，它可以让野营的负责老师有权启动任何必要的医疗程序。

12.
原来如此。谢谢您的讲解。那您帮我们预约验血吧。谢谢您。
I see. Thank you for explaining it to me. Please make an appointment for us regarding the blood test then. Thank you.
