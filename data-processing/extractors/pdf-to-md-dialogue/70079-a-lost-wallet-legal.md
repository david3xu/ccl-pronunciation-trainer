#70079. A Lost Wallet - Legal

1.
Hi. How can I help you today?
你好，我今天能怎么帮到您呢？

2.
你好。我捡到一个钱包，我想把它还给失主。
Hello. I found a wallet and I'd like to return it to the owner.

3.
Okay. Based on the color of the wallet, I think the owner is a woman. Where did you find it?
好的。从钱包的颜色来看，我想失主是女性。您在那里找到钱包的呢？

4.
在商场外面的人行道上。我当时有试着去找失主，但是当时那里一个人也没有。
I found it on the sidewalk outside a shopping mall. I tried finding the owner but no one was around at that time.

5.
Let's see if there is any IDs in the wallet. That may help us to find the owner.
我们看看钱包里有没有什么身份证件。这可能可以帮我们找到失主。

6.
我之前把钱包打开过。当时我只想找到失主。我希望我没有做错事。
I opened the wallet before. At that time, all I want was trying to find the owner. I hope I did the right thing.

7.
You have done nothing wrong by opening it and trying to find an ID in it. Just remember not to remove any stuff inside though.
打开钱包找证件是没错的。只要记得别拿走里面的东西就好啦。

8.
我保证我什么都没拿。我只是想找到钱包的主人。
Nothing was taken. I gave you my word. I just want to find the owner of the wallet.

9.
In that case, we usually keep the wallet in the Station. I hope the owner can claim it.
这样的话，我们一般是把钱包放在警察局里保管。希望失主能来认领它。

10.
我也想在商场外贴布告帮助你们。这样失主如果看到，就知道钱包在哪。
I want to help you by posting a notice outside the shopping mall. In that case, the owner will know where to find the wallet after seeing it.

11.
There's a notice board in the shopping center. Just don't mention the color of the wallet in case the wrong person claims it.
购物中心里面有公告牌的。记得别提到钱包的颜色，以免其他人来认领。

12.
好的。我就说，周二那天丢钱包的人，请到警察局去认领。
Okay. I'll just say "if you lost a wallet on Tuesday, please claim it at the Police Station".

13.
Perfect. I hope the owner can claim it soon after seeing the notice. Please leave your contact details here in case the owner wants to offer rewards for returning her wallet.
很好啊。我希望失主看到公告以后很快就能来认领。留一下你的联系方式吧，这样如果失主想要答谢你帮她找回钱包的话，能联系上你。

14.
我不想要什么答谢的。我只想把钱包还给失主。如果能找到失主，我一定会很开心的。
I don't want rewards. I just want to return the wallet to the owner. I will be very happy if we can find the owner.
