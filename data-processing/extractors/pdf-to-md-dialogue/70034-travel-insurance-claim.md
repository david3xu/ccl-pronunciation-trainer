#70034. Travel Insurance Claim - Business

1.
Hi, Mr. Wang. This is Jessica from your travel insurance company. I'm ringing you for the online claim application you submitted last week.
您好，王先生。我是您旅游保险公司的杰西卡。我给您打电话是为了您上周递交的线上理赔申请的事。

2.
你好, 杰西卡。感谢你打电话给我。我都开始怀疑是否理赔申请程序一切正常了。
Hello, Jessica. Thanks for calling me. I even begin to doubt if there's anything wrong with the claim application process.

3.
There's a slight delay. You didn't submit the documents we required. I can't process your claim without these documents.
稍微有些延误。您没有递交我们需要的文件，没有这些文件，我是不能处理您的理赔的。

4.
是这样的。我在曼谷旅游的时候，包里的手机被偷了。手机的原始收据已经找不到了。我不清楚要提交什么样的文件。
Here's the thing: My cellphone in my bag was stolen when I was traveling in Bangkok. I can't find the original receipt of the cellphone. I'm not sure what documents I need to submit.

5.
We need the original receipt. If you purchased this mobile phone in Australia, you can contact the store to reprint the receipt.
我们是需要原始收据的。如果您这部手机是在澳大利亚买的，您可以联系店家重新打印收据。

6.
哦，好主意。我都没想到。我确实是在澳大利亚买的！我回头就去联系店家。我还需要提交什么文件吗？
Good idea! That never occurred to me before. I did purchase the cellphone in Australia. I'll contact the store later. What other documents do I need to submit?

7.
Well, you also need to provide the proof that you own this mobile phone. A bank statement would be ideal. Did you report to the police after the following incident?
嗯，您还需要提供能证明您是手机主人的证据。最好能有银行的流水单。出事之后您报警了吗？

8.
当时我发现被偷以后，我马上就去附近的警察局了。不过警察的报告不是英文的，是泰文的呢。
I went to the police station nearby immediately after I found my cellphone was stolen. However, the police report is in Thai, not in English.

9.
That's great. You need to arrange a certified translation then.
太好了。那您需要提供它的认证翻译。

10.
没问题。我还留着手机原始的包装盒呢！让人惊讶的是我还有原始的包装盒。这会有用吗？
No problem. I still keep the original packing box of the cellphone! It's so surprising that I still have it! Would it be helpful?

11.
Yes, it would be helpful, because you also need to provide your phone's IMEI number, which is a 14-digit number noted on the phone box.
会有帮助的，因为您还需要提供您手机的国际移动设备识别码。这是一组 14 位的号码，在手机盒上有。

12.
好的，还有其他的吗？我可以把所有的东西都发给你。
Okay. Is there anything else? I can send everything to you.

13.
That's all. The sooner you could submit them to us, the sooner we could process your claim. You can send them to us via the E-Mail address on our website.
就这些了。您越快把这些发给我们，我们就能越快处理您的理赔。您可以通过我们网站上的电邮地址把它们发过来。

14.
太好了，谢谢你的帮助。我会尽快提交所有的材料给你。
That's great. Thanks for your help. I'll submit all the materials to you as soon as possible.
