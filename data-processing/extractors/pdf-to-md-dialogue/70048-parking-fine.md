# 70048. Parking fine - Legal

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place over the phone between a mandarin speaking driver and an English-speaking officer from the Department of Transport Victoria. The driver received a parking ticket and is making an enquiry about it. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning, what can I do for you?
(早上好。我可以为您做些什么呢？)

44. 您好， 我收到一个停车罚单，但是我不知道我为什么会收到这个罚单，您可以给我解释一下么？
(Hello. I received a parking ticket; however, I don't know why it was sent to me. Could you explain this to me please?)

45. Let me have a look. It's because you've parked somewhere you weren't supposed to. You will need to pay a fine of $180.
(让我看一下，是因为您在不能停车的区域停车了，您需要交$180 澳币的罚款。)

46. 可是我只停了 10 分钟，到商店里逛了一圈呀。
(But I've just parked my car for ten minutes to hang out in the shop for a short while.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Hang out 是个很高频好用的词组，表示闲逛：If you hang out in a particular place, you go and stay there for no particular reason. 比如：我喜欢到超市闲逛：I like to hang out in supermarkets. Hang 的过去式和过去分词都是 hung

47. But you parked in a No stopping area. That means you're not allowed to stop there at any time, not even briefly. Here's an information booklet about parking instructions and fines.
(但是您在不能停车的地方停车了。您不可以在那边停车，任何时间都不行，哪怕是只停一小会儿。这有一本小册子，里面有停车说明和罚款介绍。)

补充：Parking meter： 停车计时器

48. 好吧，我会以后更加注意道路上的标示的，那我怎么付款呢？
(Fine. I'll pay more attention to road signs. How should I pay then?)

49. You can pay here by credit card or cash, or we can arrange for you to pay installments on a payment plan.
(您可以在这用信用卡或者现金付款，或者我们也可以帮您安排分期付款计划.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Installment：分期付款
词组搭配：She paid for the car by/in installments.

8. 那麻烦您帮我安排分期付款吧。
(Please help me with the installment plan then.)

50. Okay. You will need to pay $22.50 per week, every week for eight weeks.
(好的，您需要每周支付 22.5 澳币，一共支付八周。)

51. 好的，请问如果我还不上怎么办啊？
(Okay. What if I'm not able to keep up the installments, if I may ask?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Keep up the installments = continue to pay regularly

52. You can call us or come in in person so that we can reschedule the payment.
(您可以给我们打电话，或者直接来找我们，我们会帮您重新安排付款。)

53. 好的，感谢您今天的帮助。
(Okay. Thank you for your help today.)
