Good morning, Mrs Ma. I'm glad that I can finally meet you.
早上好，马太太。很高兴总算能见到你了。

2.
早上好，不好意思我迟到了，因为我找不到你的办公室。都是我的错，我在全球定位系统里输入的地址是错的。
Good morning. I'm sorry that I'm late because I couldn't find your office. It's all my fault. I put a wrong address in the GPS.

3.
It's not good. Let's quickly get into the things you feel concerned about. Is it about your mother's visa application?
这可不太好。我们快点来看看你担心的事吧。是关于你母亲签证申请的问题吧？

4.
好的。我和我先生想了很久，打算让我中国的母亲移民过来，但是前段时间遇到一些问题耽搁了。
Okay. After thinking for a long time, my husband and I decided to ask my mother in China to migrate here. However, there were some problems and things got delayed.

5.
What kind of delay do you mean?
你说的耽误是指什么呢？

6.
我母亲想把国内的房子卖了，但是出了点问题。现在总算成功卖掉了，所以想尽快办移民手续。
My mother wanted to sell her property in China, but something happened. Now it was finally sold, therefore, we would like her to migrate here as soon as possible.

7.
I see. How old is your mother?
我明白了。您母亲多大年龄了？

8.
我母亲今年68岁，身体还算健康。她一个人住在中国，我们很担心她。
My mother is 68 years old this year and she is relatively healthy. She lives alone in China and we are very worried about her.

9.
Well, there are two types of Parent visas: Contributory Parent visa and non-Contributory Parent visa. The Contributory Parent visa costs much more but the waiting time is shorter.
嗯，有两种父母签证：付费父母签证和排队父母签证。付费父母签证费用高很多，但是等待时间更短。

10.
费用大概是多少呢？等待时间有什么区别？
How much does it cost approximately? What's the difference in waiting time?

11.
The Contributory Parent visa costs about $47,000 and the waiting time is about 2-3 years. The non-Contributory Parent visa costs about $6,000 but you may need to wait 20-30 years.
付费父母签证大约需要47,000澳币，等待时间大约2-3年。排队父母签证大约需要6,000澳币，但是可能需要等待20-30年。

12.
20到30年？那太久了！我们还是申请付费的吧。需要什么条件和材料呢？
20 to 30 years? That's too long! We'd better apply for the contributory one. What conditions and documents are required?

13.
You need to provide an Assurance of Support, which means you need to guarantee that your mother won't rely on government benefits for at least 10 years.
您需要提供经济担保，也就是说您需要保证您母亲至少10年内不依赖政府福利。

14.
这个没问题。我们有稳定的收入，完全可以承担。还需要其他什么吗？
That's no problem. We have stable income and can definitely afford it. What else is needed?

15.
Your mother also needs to pass health examinations and character tests. She needs to provide police clearance certificates from all countries she has lived in for more than 12 months since turning 16.
您母亲还需要通过健康检查和品格测试。她需要提供从16岁以来居住超过12个月的所有国家的无犯罪记录证明。
