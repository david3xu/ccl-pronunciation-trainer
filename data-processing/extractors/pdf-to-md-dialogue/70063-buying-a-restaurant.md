# 70063. Buying a restaurant – Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Jessica, an English-speaking lawyer and a mandarin-speaking client, who is making an inquiry about buying a new restaurant. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, my name is Jessica. How can I help you today?  
(您好，我是杰西卡。今天我能怎么帮到您呢？)

2. 你好，杰西卡。我想买一个餐厅。我已经问过卖家价格了。  
(Hello, Jessica. I'd like to buy a restaurant and I've asked the seller about the price.)

词组搭配：ask someone about something

3. Okay. How's the business going? Is it profitable?  
(好的。餐厅生意怎么样？盈利吗？)

4. 他们生意还挺好的。门口经常排很长的队。  
(The business is running very well and people are always waiting in long lines for it.)

5. Well, it's important to check its financial record thoroughly so that you can get a clearer picture of how much you need to run it and how much you can make. You may also ask a good accountant to review it.  
(嗯，彻查一下餐厅的财务记录也是很重要的，这样您更能知道运营这个餐厅要多少钱，以及您可以赚多少钱。您也可以找个靠谱的会计来看一下。)

6. 好，我会去查一下的。那个卖家还拥有餐厅所在的大楼，说楼也可以租给我。不过我现在还没那么多钱呢。  
(Okay, I'll have a check. The seller also owns the building of the restaurant and said he could lease the building to me. But I don't have that much money now.)

我会去查一下的：I'll have a check (略英式的表达)  
I'll check it out/I'll check into it (美式)  
出租：lease 比 rent 更长期，比如至少六个月起。

7. Checking its financial report can help you make sure that the business is working properly. I'm happy to help you to review the rental agreement. Would you also like to keep the employees? If so, I'll help review the contract for you.  
(查一下财报可以帮你确保餐厅的生意没问题。我可以帮你看一下租赁合同。你想保留员工吗？如果保留的话，我再帮你看一下合同。)

Help somebody (to)do something

8. 那些员工我都会留下的，他们很会做生意的。我需要他们的帮助，把餐厅经营好。  
(I'll keep them. They're very good at doing business and I could really use their help to keep the restaurant running smoothly.)

9. This is a big decision. You can book another appointment once you get those documents, so that we could review them together and make sure it's the right decision.  
(这是个很重大的决定啊。好的，等您拿到那些文件了，可以再跟我约个时间，我们一起看一下文件，确保买这个生意是个正确的决定。)

10. 那就太好了。一想到能买这个餐厅，我就非常激动。但是，如果它不赚钱的话，我也不想做一个错误的决定。  
(That's great. The idea of buying this restaurant really excites me. However, I don't want to make a wrong decision if it's not making money.)

11. That's true. You've absolutely made the right decision to seek professional advice before buying the business.  
(您说的对。您在买这个生意之前，能先来寻求专业咨询，已经是一个再正确不过的决定了。)

12. 我很高兴我不用自己准备这些东西。一有消息，我就跟你约下一次见面。谢谢你的帮助。  
(I'm glad that I don't have to prepare all these by myself. I'll make an appointment with you once I have any updates/once I have any new/once any new information comes to light. Thank you for your help.)
