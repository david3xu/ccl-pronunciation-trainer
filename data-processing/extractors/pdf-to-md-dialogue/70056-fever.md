1. Hi, thanks for calling nurse advice on-call, I'm Sarah, how can I help you tonight?  
(你好，感谢致电当值护士建议专线。我是萨拉，今晚有什么可以帮你的吗？)

2. 你好萨拉，我很担心我儿子的情况。他咳嗽，睡不着觉，出汗而且身体很烫。我怀疑是病毒感染。  
(Hello, Sarah. I'm worried about my son. He's coughing and he can't sleep. He's sweating and his body is burning. I doubt if it's a viral infection.)

3. Ok, how old is your son? Why do you think it's a viral infection?  
(好，你儿子多大了？你为什么觉得是病毒感染呢？)

4. 他四岁了。我妻子觉得他可能是和一群孩子玩的时候被传染了。有一些孩子生病了。  
(He is four years old. My wife thinks he might have got infected while playing with some kids. Some of them got sick.)

5. That's possible, has he taken the flu shot for this year?  
(有可能。他今年打流感疫苗了吗？)

6. 有的，他打了。医生说他可以打疫苗了。他很乖的，医生给他打针的时候他都没有哭。  
(Yes, he has. The doctor said he could get vaccinated. He's a good boy. He didn't even cry when the doctor was giving the shot.)

7. If he has been vaccinated then it is unlikely that it is the flu, it may be a bad cold, which causes his cough and high body temperature.  
(如果他已经打过疫苗了，就不太可能是得流感了。可能是重感冒导致了他咳嗽和体温高。)

8. 我很担心他。我摸他的身体感觉很热，我要怎么知道他没有太热了呢？  
(I'm very worried about him. I touched his body and he's burning. How do I tell if it is not too hot?)

9. If you have a thermometer, you can test his temperature. Just place it under his tongue or in his armpit and tell me what it says.  
(如果你有体温计的话，可以测一下他的体温。把体温计放在他舌头下面或者腋下，然后告诉我读数。)

10. 我的妻子已经用体温计放在他的舌头下测过了，温度是 38 摄氏度，这很高吗？  
(My wife has already used a thermometer under his tongue. It's 38 degrees Celsius. Is it too high?)

11. He does have a fever, but the temperature is not dangerously high, there's no need to worry too much about that.  
(他确实是发烧了。但是他的体温不是高到危险的那种。不需要太担心。)

12. 那我就放心了，我需要做些什么呢？  
(That's a relief. What should I do?)

13. It's impossible for me to say it clearly over the phone, does your son have any medical conditions or any allergies?  
(电话里不太能说清楚，你儿子有没有什么健康上的问题或者过敏呢？)

14. 没有，他没什么健康问题，也没对什么东西过敏。他很健康，很少生病。  
(No, he doesn't have any medical conditions or allergies. He's quite healthy and he rarely gets sick.)

15. I suggest you give him some paracetamol and take him to the doctor in the morning. If things get worse before morning, please call triple zero.  
(我建议你给他吃一些扑热息痛，早上带他去看医生。如果在早上之前情况恶化了，就打 000。)

16. 我这里有一些液体的扑热息痛。我之前还很担心的，现在我感觉好多了，我很高兴我打了这个电话。塞拉，谢谢你。  
(I have some liquid paracetamol. I was so worried before. Now I feel much better. I'm glad that I made this call. Thank you Sarah.)
