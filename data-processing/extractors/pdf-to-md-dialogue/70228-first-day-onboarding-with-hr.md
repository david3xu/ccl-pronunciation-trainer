#70228. First-Day Onboarding with HR - Business

1.
Good morning, and welcome to our company! I'm Jill in HR, and I'll be guiding you through today's orientation.
早上好，欢迎加入我们公司！我是人力资源部的吉尔，我会带你走一遍今天的入职流程。

2.
你好，吉尔。谢谢您抽时间见我，这份新工作让我非常激动，我也很想尽快融入团队！
Hello Jill. Thank you for taking time to meet me. I'm really excited about this new role and eager to fit in with the team.

3.
That's great news! We're thrilled to have you work here and we truly appreciate every new employee joining our company.
太好了！您能来这工作，我们也非常高兴。我们真心感激每位加入公司的新员工。

4.
我在接受这个职位前，和几位员工聊过。他们都对这里的工作氛围赞不绝口。
Before accepting the offer, I spoke with a few employees. They all spoke highly of the work atmosphere here.

5.
We do take pride in our company culture and how we take care of our employees. We hope you'll find it rewarding working here.
我们确实对公司文化和员工关怀很自豪，希望你在这工作会有成就感。

6.
我相信一定会的。我以前没在这么大规模的公司工作。我听说这里有完善的入职培训。
I'm sure I will. I've never worked at such a large company before. I heard that you have thorough onboarding training.

7.
Exactly! It helps newcomers settle in smoothly. We walk you through everything from day one, starting with basic training.
没错！这样新人能顺利适应。我们从第一天就手把手指导，从基础培训开始。

8.
真好。你们有指导手册可以帮我更快融入吗？还有，放我进来的保安说，我得有一个员工证。
That's great! Do you have a guidebook to help me settle in faster? Also, the security guard who let me in said I need a staff ID card.

9.
Yes, you'll need it for building entry and elevator access. We'll take your photo and print the card right away. Then I'll introduce you to your mentor.
是的，你得用它进大楼和用电梯。我们会马上给你拍照做卡，然后我会带您去见您的导师。

10.
还有导师吗？真好！照片的话，希望不会太难看，我一向不太喜欢拍证件照。
And I even have a mentor? That's amazing! About the photo... I hope it won't turn out too bad. I've always hated taking ID photos.

11.
Tell me about it! But no stress, we'll take a few, and you can pick the one you like best.
可不是嘛！不过别紧张，我们会多拍几张，你可以挑一张满意的。

12.
听你这么说，我就没那么紧张了。你们团队的氛围太温暖了，我都觉得我已经适应这里了。
Now that you say that, I feel less nervous. Your team has such a welcoming vibe. I already feel like I belong here!

13.
You will find your way before you know it! We hope you'll enjoy your time working here. Every day is different in our company.
你很快就能上手了！希望你喜欢在这儿工作。我们公司的每一天都不一样。

14.
太好了！这正是吸引我入职的原因。我知道在这工作不会无聊。我都等不及要开始啦。
Perfect! That's exactly why I joined. I know it won't be boring working here. I can't wait to start!
