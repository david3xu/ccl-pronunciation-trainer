#70078. College Course Inquiry - Education

1.
Hello. Welcome to our college. My name is Tony. How can I help you this morning?
你好，欢迎来我们学校。我是托尼。今早我能如何帮到你呢？

2.
你好，托尼。我刚进入你们的电脑课程。我有一些问题想问你。
Hello, Tony. I have just enrolled in your computer course and I have some questions.

3.
Well done for being accepted by the college. I'm sure you'll enjoy our computer course. What questions do you want to ask?
能被学校录取，真的太好啦。我想你一定会很喜欢我们的电脑课程的。你有哪些问题呢？

4.
我刚刚收到你们的电子邮件，上面有一个注册表格的链接，里面有两个开学日期。但是，我不知道哪个才是对的。
I just received your email. There's a link to a registration form in the email and there are two start dates. However, I'm not sure which one is correct.

5.
If you can give me the name of the course, I'll check that for you. I'm sure you don't want to miss your first day.
你把课程名字报给我吧，我帮你查一下。我想你肯定不想错过开学第一天的。

6.
是呀，我真的非常期待学习这个课程。如果我错过了开学，那真的会很糟糕。我报的是电脑和信息技术初级课程。
Yes. I'm keen to this course. It will truly be a disaster if I miss the first day. The course I signed up for is Computing and IT-Introductory.

7.
There are two classes for this course. One is full time and the other is part time. That's why there are different start dates.
这个课程有两种班型的。一种是全日制的，一种是非全日制的。所以开学日期不一样啦。

8.
哦，那我明白了。我报的是全日制课程。谢谢你。
Okay, I see. The course I signed up for is full time. Thank you.

9.
You are very welcome. It can be confusing if there are two classes. What other questions do you have?
不客气的。同时有两种课程确实能让人很迷糊。你还有哪些其他的问题呢？

10.
我想要了解一下学费的事情。请问我可以分期付款吗？
I'd like to know about the tuition fee. Do you accept payment by instalments, if I may ask?

11.
Yes, you can. Once you have filled in the registration form, you can go to the financial office to arrange a payment plan.
可以的。你填写好登记表以后，可以去财务办公室那边安排一下付款方案。

12.
太好了。对我来说，分期付款比一次性付款容易很多。因为我在学习期间会做兼职工作。
That's great. For me, payment by instalments can be much easier than a lump sum payment, because I'll work part time while I study.

13.
When you have completed your enrolment process, you'll get a student account. You can pay the tuition fee through the account. Also, your course information is listed on it.
你在办完入学手续以后，会拿到一个学生账号。你可以通过这个账号来交学费。另外，你的课程信息也列在上面了。

14.
听起来挺简单的，我现在就去填好登记表。谢谢你的帮助，托尼。
That sounds simple. I'll fill out the registration form now. Thanks for your help, Tony.
