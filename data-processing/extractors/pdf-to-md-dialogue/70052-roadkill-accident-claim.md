# 70052. Roadkill accident claim - Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking insurance clerk and a mandarin speaking client. The client just had a car accident and would like to make a claim. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello! Thank you for holding. I'm very sorry for the delay! How may I help you today?
(您好，感谢您的等待。很抱歉让您久等。我今天能怎么帮到您呢？)

90. 你好，我们前几天发生了交通事故，车子撞的很严重。幸好没有人受伤。我想要申请索赔。
(Hi. We had a traffic accident several days ago. The car has been severely damaged. Luckily, no one was injured. I'd like to make a claim.)

91. I'm sorry to hear that. As you said，tankfully, no one was injured, it seems that you have hit an animal. When did the accident happen?
(听到这个我深表遗憾。您说幸好没人受伤，那听上去好像是您撞到了动物。是什么时候的事呢？)

92. 是的。我感觉应该撞到了一只大袋鼠。时间是大概晚上十点。我根本没看见它，不知道它从什么地方突然跳出来了。我们听到“砕！”的一声。我们都吓坏了.
(Right. I felt that the car must have hit a big kangaroo. It was around 10 o'clock in the evening and I hadn't seen it at all. Out of nowhere, it suddenly jumped out. We heard a loud bang and we were terrified.)

Terrified：very frightened 非常害怕的

93. Well, many animals become roadkill in Australia. You must have heard of that happening often.
(嗯，在澳大利亚，很多动物都在路上被轧死了。您一定也总听说吧！)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Roadkill: 不可数名词：路上被轧死的动物。

94. 是的，我听说过。但是我们的损失也很严重啊！我的车子侧面和前面都凹进去了，前挡风玻璃也碎了。
(Yes, I've heard of that. But we have also suffered a great loss. The side and front of my car were dented, and the front windshield was broken.)

95. I'm sorry to hear that. It is stated in a specific clause of the policy that the insurance doesn't cover damage caused by animals, accidents that take place outside the city region or after dark. Where did the accident happen?
(听到这个我很抱歉。保险单里专门有一项条款是，您的保险不报销动物造成的损失，不报销发生在市区外的事故，也不报销天黑以后发生的事故。您是在哪里出的事呢？)

96. 当然是发生在市区外了！你在市区马路上看到过袋鼠跳来跳去吗？！
(Of course it took place outside the city region! Have you ever seen kangaroos jumping around on a city road?)

97. Well, you'll be surprised where you can find kangaroos in Australia.
(这个嘛，在澳大利亚，能发现袋鼠的地方是让人惊喜的。)

98. 我才不想要什么惊喜呢！我就想要修车的钱。修这个车需要好几千块钱呢！你的意思是说你们不给赔偿吗？
(Surprise is the last thing I want. I just want the money to repair the car. It costs thousands of dollars to repair it! Do you mean that the payout is impossible/off the table?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
the last thing I want = something that I certainly do not want
If something is off the table, it is no longer available or is not being considered.

11. I'm sorry but we have to follow the policy. There's nothing more we can do.
(我很抱歉，但是我们得按保险单来。我们也爱莫能助了。)

99. 好吧，算我倒霉。无论如何，谢谢你了。
(Okay. It's not my day today. Thanks anyway.)

Not someone's day: someone has experienced a day of misfortunes
