# 70088. City Sports Centre - Education

**Briefing:** This dialogue takes place between a parent and an employee at a Sports Centre. The parent is asking the employee how to enrol in sports lessons.

1. Good afternoon, welcome to the City Sports Centre.
(下午好，欢迎来到城市体育中心。)

2. 你好，我们最近刚搬到这里，我儿子很想参加体育活动，他今年九岁了。
(Hi, we just moved here. My son really wants to do some sports. He is nine years old now.)

3. We offer different kinds of activities for his age group. What activities does your son like?
(我们为他这个年龄段提供不同种类的活动。您儿子喜欢什么样的活动呢？)

4. 我儿子喜欢足球篮球和网球。他一定很高兴参加体育活动，这样他就可以认识新朋友了。
(My son likes soccer, basketball, and tennis. He must be thrilled about playing sports, since he can make more new friends.)

5. We provide soccer, basketball and tennis courses. The most popular at his age group is tennis.
(我们的确也提供足球、篮球和网球的课程。他这个年龄段的孩子最喜欢网球。)

6. 我儿子很喜欢在电视上看网球比赛。我想他应该想学习网球吧，特别是跟同龄的小朋友一起。
(My son likes watching tennis games on TV. He might want to learn tennis, I guess, especially he can play with kids of similar age.)

7. The tennis coach is on fridays. it starts from 4pm and ends at 5pm. we also have tennis competitions each Saturday.
(这个网球教练每周五上课，下午 4 点开始，5 点结束。我们每个礼拜六还有网球比赛。)

8. 我不确定我儿子是不是想参加比赛。希望不参加比赛教练也让我们报名。
(I'm not sure if son wants to compete in a contest. I hope we can still get enrolled if we don't attend the competitions.)

9. Of course. Many students enjoy the coached lessons without attending the competitions.
(当然可以。很多学生没有参加比赛，也很喜欢教练课程。)

10. 那我就放心了。学会打网球之后，可能会参加比赛。请问学费是多少？
(That's a relief. He might attend competitions after he knows how to play tennis, though. May I please know the fees?)

11. The fee is $150 per term. you can pay in cash or by credit card if that's easier for you.
(学费是每学期 150 澳币。您可以现金支付，也可以信用卡支付，如果您觉得更方便的话。)

12. 我有现金，现在就可以支付。我想让他尽快上课。
(I have cash with me. I can pay now. I would like him to start as soon as possible.)

13. You can start this week. please fill out this registration form. we need your address, phone number and details of any medical conditions.
(您可以这周就开始上课。请填写这个注册表格。我们需要您的住址、电话号码，以及(他的)任何身体状况。)

14. 好的，我们还没有网球拍(tennis racket)，我们需要买拍子吗？
(Okay. We don't have a tennis racket yet. Do we need to buy one?)

15. To begin with you can hire, that way, you'll know if your son likes it before buying one.
(您可以先租一个拍子，这样您可以知道您儿子到底是否喜欢，然后再决定要不要买。)

16. 谢谢，这主意太棒了。你给了我们很大的帮助。很期待第一节课.
(Thank you! That's a great idea. You've been helping us a lot. We are looking forward to the first lesson.)
