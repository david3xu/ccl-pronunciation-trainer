#70188. A Low-score University Assignment - Education

1.
Good afternoon! Come in and take a seat please. I received your email saying you wanted to meet me.
下午好！请进，请坐。我收到了你发的邮件，说你想跟我见面。

2.
您好。是的。谢谢您抽时间见我。
Hello. Yes, thank you for taking the time to see me.

3.
That's totally fine. I try to leave some free time available each day for students. I hope your studies are going well.
没关系。我每天都会尽量给学生留出些空余时间。希望你学习进展顺利。

4.
事实上，我对我第一篇论文的分数不是很满意。我不理解您为什么会给我这么低的分数。
In fact, I'm not very satisfied with the grade I received for my first paper. I don't understand why you gave me such a low score.

5.
Oh, right. I wanted to have a talk with you about that, but I just haven't had the chance.
哦，对。我本来就想和你谈谈这件事，只是一直没机会。

6.
我明白。希望您可以给我一些反馈。距离下一节课还有一小时，希望时间足够。
I understand. I hope you can give me some feedback. There's still an hour until the next class, so I hope we have enough time.

7.
The reason your paper isn't as good as it could be is the structure of your essay. Your ideas are fine, but the paper lacks a clear logical flow.
你论文成绩不理想的原因在于文章的结构。你的观点没问题，但论文缺乏清晰的逻辑性。

8.
哦。我的论文里确实有几个部分是最后几分钟才写的，所以写得比较仓促。我担心涵盖不了题目的所有要求。
Oh. There were indeed a few parts in my paper that I wrote in the final minutes, so they ended up a bit rushed. I was worried that I wouldn't cover all the requirements of the topic.

9.
I see. That might explain why your arguments aren't set up well. It's often not a good idea to keep reworking your paper.
我明白了。这或许能解释为什么你的论点组织得不够好。不断地反复修改论文往往不是个好主意。

10.
我确实有这么做。我发现这篇论文比我想象中要难写，因为需要涵盖很多内容。
I did keep reworking it. I found that this paper was harder to write than I imagined because there was so much to cover.

11.
It is indeed a complicated topic. It's easy to lose direction, especially for university-level assignments.
这个话题确实复杂。很容易迷失方向，尤其是大学程度的作业。

12.
这跟我的中学作业不太一样。我想取得好成绩，但我真的需要帮助。
It's not like my secondary school assignments. I want to get good grades, but I really need some help.

13.
I know a teacher who offers great tutoring sessions on writing papers for first-year students every week. I can give you the details if you're interested.
我认识一位老师，每周都会给大一新生进行论文写作辅导，效果很不错。如果你有兴趣，我可以把详细情况告诉你。

14.
好的，谢谢您。这听起来真是个好主意。我相信这会对我下一次写论文大有帮助。
Okay, thank you. That sounds like a great idea. I believe it will really help me improve my next paper.
