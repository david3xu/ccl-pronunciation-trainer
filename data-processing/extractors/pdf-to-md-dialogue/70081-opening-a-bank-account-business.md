# 70081. Opening a bank account - Business

**Briefing:** The following dialogue takes place between Jane, an English-speaking bank teller and a Mandarin-speaking client who wants to open a new account. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hi, I am Jane. What can I do for you today?
(您好，我是简。今天我能为您做些什么呢？)

2. 你好, 简。我最近刚开始一份全职工作。我想开一个新的银行账户。
(Hello, John. I've recently started a full-time job and I'd like to open a new bank account.)

3. Well, I'm more than happy to help you with that. There are some people who open an account for automatic transactions so it's more convenient for them to pay their bills; and there are some people who open an account for saving money.
(嗯，这个我很乐意为您效劳。有些人开户是用来自动转账的，这样他们支付账单就更方便了。而有些人开户是用来存钱的。)

4. 我想要开一个储蓄账户，这样我就可以存钱买物业了。我已经有一个支付账户了。
(I'd like to open a savings account so that I can save (up) for a property/save money to buy a property. I already have a debit account.)

5. That's good to hear. It will be much easier to apply for a home loan from a bank if you already have a savings account.
(那很好。如果您已经有储蓄账户了，跟银行申请房贷就容易得多了。)

6. 那太好啦。能找到全职工作真的很好，这样我就能存更多的钱了。
(That's good. It's great that I've found a full-time job so that I can save more money.)

7. You may choose to deposit money weekly or monthly after you open a savings account. The amount of your interest will depend on how much you deposit.
(在您开了存款账户以后，您可以选择按周存，或者按月存。您能拿多少利息，要看您存多少钱。)

8. 好的，那对我来说，最简单的方法就是每个月存一次钱啦，因为我每个月发一次工资。我可以选择存款数额吗？
(Okay. The easiest way for me is to deposit money every month because I get paid monthly. Do I get to decide the amount deposited?)

9. Well, you have to make a minimum deposit of $200 every month. There's no maximum limit though.
(这个嘛，每个月您最少得存 200 澳币，不过没有上限。)

10. 200 澳币可以的。我肯定能存 200 澳币以上的。
($200 is acceptable. I'll definitely deposit more than $200.)

11. That's great. Apart from that, you can withdraw money monthly without having to pay any fees.
(那很好。另外呢，您还可以每个月取钱，这个是不会额外收费的。)

12. 太好啦。我应该不会取钱的。你能告诉我要怎么开户吗？我已经把身份文件都带来了。
(That's great. I don't think I'll withdraw money. Could you explain to me how to open an account? I've already got my identity documents here.)

13. That's great. I just need your identity documents since you have already had an account with us. I will help you open a new account now.
(那很好。因为您已经在我们这开过户了，您把身份文件给我就可以了。我现在就帮您开新账户。)

14. 谢谢你，太好啦。我希望我能早点存够钱去买物业。
(Thank you. This is really great. I hope I could save enough money to buy a property as soon as possible.)
