# 70076. Meeting a new neighbor – Social

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a Mandarin-speaking woman who just moved to her new house and her English-speaking neighbor, Vanessa. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hi, I'm Vanessa. You must be our new neighbor! We just live next to yours.

(你好，我是瓦妮莎。你一定就是我们的新邻居啦！我们就住在你家隔壁。)

2. 你好，瓦妮莎。很高兴认识你！是呀，我们今天才刚刚搬进新家。

(Hi, Vanessa! It's great to meet you! Yeah, we just moved to our new house today.)

3. Welcome to this neighborhood! There are many lovely families in this area. Do you have children?

(欢迎搬到这里！这个区有很多非常友善的家庭。你有孩子吗？)

4. 是的，我们有一个小女儿，五岁。她整个上午都到处跑来跑去，对我们的新家很兴奋呢！

(Yes, we have a little daughter. She's five years old. She's been running around for the entire morning and she's so excited about our new house!)

5. We also have a son. He's five years old and he goes to the school just at the end of the road. It's a very nice school if you are looking for one for your daughter.

(我家也有个儿子呢。他五岁了，就在这条路走到底的那个学校上学。如果你在给女儿选学校，那家学校很棒的。)

6. 我正打算星期一帮她办理注册入学呢！我很高兴她这么快就能认识新同学！这附近有什么适合孩子们玩的公园吗？

(I was just planning to enroll her next Monday! I'm so glad that she gets to meet a new classmate this soon! Are there any parks nearby that are suitable for children?)

Get to do something: have the opportunity to do something

7. There is one park in a short walking distance from here. There are a lot of good play equipment and it is very popular. Local children often go there after school.

(这附近有一个公园，稍微走几步就到。那个公园里有很多游乐设施，特别受欢迎。当地的孩子经常放学以后去那玩。)

Equipment 不可数

8. 太好了！谢谢你！等我们安顿下来以后，明天我们会去看一下的。我们还有好多东西要开箱跟整理。

(That's great! Thank you! We'll go take a look tomorrow after we get everything settled. We still have loads of stuff to unpack and organize.)

9. Yes, moving to a new place can be a big job. Just ask me if you have anything that you'd like to know about this area.

(是呀，搬新家可是个大活儿。如果你对这个区有任何想知道的，就直接来问我。)

10. 我想问问什么时候收垃圾呢？我们以前住的地方是每两周来收一次垃圾。我不想错过时间。

(When will the garbage be collected, if I may ask? In our old place, it's collected every two weeks. I don't want to miss it.)

11. I understand that. Garbage is collected once a week and it's every Thursday. You will see everyone pulling out their bins, so you won't miss it.

(我懂的。垃圾每周收一次，时间是每个周四。你会看到大家都把垃圾桶拖出来的，所以你不会错过的。)

12. 每周收一次！太好了。真的很高兴能认识你。我要回去继续开箱跟整理了。

(Once a week! That's terrific. It's really nice to meet you. I have to go back to unpack and organize.)

13. It's really nice to meet you too. We might join you to the park tomorrow if you'd like us to show you around this area.

(我也很高兴认识你。如果你们想让我们带你们转转这个区的话，明天我们公园见。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
这里有新同学补充，这段说的是：See you in the park tomorrow. I can show you around in this area. (明天公园见。我可以带你在附近转转。)

14. 真是太好了！我们在这一定能住得很开心的。谢谢你的热心，瓦妮莎。

(That's great! We'll definitely enjoy living here. Thank you for being so kind, Vanessa.)
