#70217. Clarifying Local Dog Leash Rules - Legal

1.
Good afternoon, you have reached the City Council. How may I help you today?
下午好，这里是市政厅。今天有什么可以帮您的？

2.
你好，我想咨询一下这里遛狗的法律法规。听说有些邻居看到狗就吓一跳，所以我想先搞清楚规矩。
Hello, I want to ask about the dog-walking regulations here. I heard some neighbours get startled when they see dogs, so I'd like to know the rules first.

3.
Absolutely! Having a dog means following rules. We've got straightforward regulations to keep everyone safe. Have you had a chance to check any local regulations?
当然可以！养狗意味着要守规矩。我们有明文规定来保障每个人的安全。您有看过本地的相关法规吗？

4.
具体还真的不太清楚。我就知道得给狗拴上牵绳，但是，像狗狗能不能去海滩这些细节，我就懵了。
I'm not really sure about the details. I just know I have to leash my dog, but when it comes to details like whether dogs are allowed on the beach, I'm completely lost.

5.
Your dog needs to be leashed in public spaces. However, we have two designated off-leash parks where they can roam. Also, the southern section of the beach is also leash-free!
在公共区域必须给狗拴牵绳。不过，我们有两个专门的无牵绳公园，可以让狗狗自由奔跑。海滩的南段也允许放开牵绳。

6.
太棒了。我的狗特别喜欢在水里踩来踩去，在沙子里打滚，还会追那些海鸥。请问有哪些地方是不允许狗狗去的吗？
That's great. My dog loves splashing around in the water, rolling in the sand, and chasing seagulls. Are there any spots where dogs aren't allowed?

7.
Indeed, dogs aren't allowed in certain spots like kids' playgrounds, sports ovals, and some beaches. Just look out for the signs before you go in.
确实，有些地方不允许带狗，比如儿童游乐场、运动场以及部分沙滩。进去前留意公告牌就行。

8.
了解了。如果我一不留神，没有遵守规定，会有什么处罚吗？最惨会怎么样呀？
Understood. If I accidentally don't follow the rules, what penalties might I face? What's the worst that could happen?

9.
If you break the rules, like letting your dog off-leash where it's banned, you might get fined. Fines vary based on how serious the breach is.
如果违反规定，比如在禁止区域不牵绳，就可能被罚款。罚金数额取决于违规的严重程度。

10.
我的狗狗很热情，见人就扑，我还真的要多留意。还有什么其他遛狗时要注意的吗？
My dog's so friendly—always jumps on everyone it meets. I really need to pay extra attention. Any other dog-walking dos and don'ts I need to look out for?

11.
Absolutely, remember to pick up after your dog. Leaving dog waste means a fine as well. We've placed bins in most parks.
没错，记得清理狗狗的排泄物。没有清理也意味着被罚款。我们在大多数公园里都设有垃圾箱。

12.
我一定会清理狗狗的粪便的。谢谢你的解答！要不是你提醒，我还真没注意这些细节呢。
I'll definitely clean up after my dog. Thanks for your explanation! If you hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have noticed those details.

13.
Anytime! You can also check the council's website for off-leash maps. If anything else comes up, swing by our office or give us a ring.
随时乐意效劳。您还可以在市政厅网站上查看不用牵绳区域的地图。如果还有其他问题，可以来我们办公室或打电话咨询。

14.
太好了，我这就去看一下网站上的地图。这周末我就带它去那个海滩的南边。再次感谢你的帮助！
Great, I'll check the map on the website right away. I'll take my dog down to the south end of the beach this weekend. Thanks again for your help!
