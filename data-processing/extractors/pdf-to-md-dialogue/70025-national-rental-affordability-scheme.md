#70025. National Rental Affordability Scheme - Housing

1.
Hello, Mr.Lei. I'm Vanessa Smith. I'm your new tenancy manager from the National Rental Affordability Scheme. I'm going to talk to you about the standard administrative procedure about your rental renewal. Did you get my email?
你好，雷先生。我是瓦妮莎史密斯。我是国民廉租房计划的新租赁经理。我要跟你谈谈你续租的标准管理程序。你收到我的邮件了吗？

2.
早上好瓦妮莎。我收到你的邮件了，但是，我不明白，你要的全部材料，我去年租房子的时候已经交过了。为什么现在还要再提交呢？
Good morning, Vanessa. Yes, I received your email. However, I don't understand that I have already submitted all the materials you asked when I rented the place last year. Why do I need to provide them again?

3.
Well, updated information will be needed annually to assess the tenants' eligibility to continue to live in their affordable rental dwellings provided by the Scheme. So we need to update your information every year. Is there any change to your living condition, family composition, or the professions of your family members?
嗯，每年我们都需要更新信息，来评估租客是否有资格继续居住在由廉租房计划提供的廉租房里。所以我们每年都需要更新你的信息。你的生活条件，家庭组成或者你家庭成员的职业有什么变动吗？

4.
哦。我老婆几个月前找到了新的工作。还有，我的小舅子跟他老婆分居了，他付不起房租，就住在我家的空房间里。我也在等着涨工资。
Okay. My wife found a new job several months ago. Also, my brother-in-law has separated with his wife. He couldn't afford the rent, so he lives in our spare room. I'm also waiting for a pay raise.

5.
I see. The reason I asked is that these factors might affect your eligibility for affordable rental dwellings, as your household income may increase above the income limit. Will he live with you permanently?
我了解了。我这样问的原因是，这些因素可能会影响你们继续住在廉租房里的资格，因为你的家庭收入可能会超过收入限制。他会一直住在你们这吗？

6.
是的。他会一直住下去的。他自己付不起房租。但是，我的工资一直没有变，所以我的资格不会受到影响的。
Yes, he'll live with us permanently. He can't afford his rent. But my income hasn't changed, so my eligibility won't be affected.

7.
I see. I need to clarify this information. Because your eligibility depends on your gross household income of all residents under the roof, the updated information will be assessed.
我了解了。我需要澄清一下这个信息。因为你的资格取决于所有住在你家里人的总收入，我们要评估你最新的信息。

8.
我以为只有我的收入才算家庭主要收入，而且我的工资一直也没变。天啊，这是要赶我们走吗？这简直难以置信。
I thought only my income would be counted as the principal household income. Besides, my salary always remains the same. Gosh, are you kicking us out? I can't believe it!

9.
That's not necessarily the case. The income limit change depending on your family composition. It cannot exceed the income limit by 25% or more in two consecutive years. However, there are still many documents to present before making the final decision. You do need to keep updating any changes to your living condition though.
不一定的。收入限制会根据你的家庭组成而变化，不可以连续两年超过收入限制的25%或以上。不过，我们在做最终决定之前还有很多文件需要你提供。但是你确实需要保持更新你们任何生活条件上的变更。

10.
好吧。我知道了。现在我还有什么能做的呢？你说的那些文件是指什么呢？我会跟我老婆和小舅子商量一下，然后马上准备的。
Okay. I see. Is there anything I could do now? What are the documents you mentioned? I'll have a discussion with my wife and my brother-in-law and then prepare right away.

11.
All the details are in the email I sent you. All income earners need to provide updated documents including their pay slips, tax documents and letters from employers.
所有详情都在我给你发的邮件里了。每个有收入的人都需要提供最新的文件，包括工资单，税务文件和雇主出具的信件。

12.
我记得这些文件之前都提交过啊。现在还要再来提交，真是头疼啊。
I remember that I have submitted those documents previously. Now I have to do it again. It's such a headache.

13.
Yes. The assessment is carried out every year. If the household income exceeds the applicable household income limit by 25 per cent or more in two consecutive eligibility years, the tenant will cease to be an eligible tenant.
是的，评估每年都要做的。如果家庭收入在连续两个资格年內，超过了适用家庭收入限制的25%或以上，租客就会失去租住资格。

14.
好吧我知道了。那我打起精神来准备一下全部的文件。我真希望我们还能继续住在这里。谢谢。
Okay. I see. Then I'll gather myself up and prepare all the documents. I really hope we could still live here. Thanks.
