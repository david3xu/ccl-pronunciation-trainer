#70038. Fever - Medical

1.
Good morning. How can I help you today?
早上好。我今天能怎么帮您呢？

2.
医生您好。我觉得不太舒服。还觉得很虚弱。我甚至都不能开车。今天我女儿不得不送我来医院。
Hello, doctor. I feel unwell and weak. I wasn't even able to drive, and my daughter had to bring me to the hospital today.

3.
Oh dear, what happened?
天啊，你怎么了？

4.
我也不知道。两天前我就头疼，恶心，肌肉酸痛。一开始我以为是流感，但现在我也不太确定。
I have no idea. I've had a headache and felt nauseous and muscle soreness since two days ago. At first, I thought it's the flu, but I'm not sure now.

5.
It seems that you have a fever. Did you take Paracetamol?
你好像发烧了。你吃扑热息痛了吗？

6.
有的。但是我的体温没降。昨天半夜我吃了药，开始有降温，后来温度又升上去了。
Yes, but my body temperature hasn't dropped. I took some medicine in the middle of last night and my temperature went down at first, but then it went up again.

7.
Don't worry, you can take a blood test first. You may have picked up a virus. When did you last travel overseas?
别担心，你可以先去验血。你可能被传染上病毒了。你上次出国是什么时候？

8.
我上周刚从国外出差回来。
I just came back last week from a business trip overseas.

9.
It's a possibility that you may have picked up virus transmitted by mosquitoes and you may have malaria, which is a disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. No matter what, a mosquito can transfer a virus or a parasite to you through its saliva. You still need to keep taking Paracetamol and Vitamin C.
你有可能感染上了蚊子传播的病毒，得了疟疾，这是一种通过被感染的蚊子叮咬来传播的疾病。不管怎么说，蚊子都会通过它的唾液来传播病毒或者寄生虫。你还是需要继续服用扑热息痛和维生素 C。

10.
我已经很注意了。我用了驱蚊器，但是还是被咬了几下。怎么办，我还要工作呢！
I was already being very careful. I used a mosquito repeller but I still got several mosquito stings. What should I do! I still need to work!

11.
I understand that you find it frustrating. However, you could only wait and rest. Currently, there's no effective vaccine for it.
我能理解你觉得很沮丧。但是，你也只能等着，好好休息。目前，这病还没有特别有效的疫苗。

12.
好的。希望我不需要住院。
Okay. I hope I don't have to be hospitalized.

13.
You need to protect yourself from mosquito stings. Otherwise, the virus will spread.
你得别再让自己被蚊子叮了，要不然病毒会扩散的。

14.
好的，那我也只能等着了。希望老天保佑我没事啊。谢谢医生。
Okay. Then I have no choice but to wait. I hope I could be okay. Fingers crossed. Thank you, doctor.
