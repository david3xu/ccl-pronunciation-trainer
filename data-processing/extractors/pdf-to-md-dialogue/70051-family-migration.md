# 70051. Family migration - Immigration

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking migration agent and a mandarin speaking woman, who is enquiring about helping her mother and sister migrate to Australia. The dialogue starts now.

1. 下午好，我想问一下关于申请我母亲和姐姐来澳洲的相关信息。
(Good afternoon. I want to make an enquiry about my mother and my elder sister's coming to Australia.)

76. Good afternoon. Could you please tell me some information about your family?
(下午好。您能跟我说下您家里的情况吗？)

77. 好的。我现在是澳大利亚永久居民，我丈夫是澳大利亚公民。我听说像我这样的情况，给我家人办移民很容易，是吗？
(Okay. I'm a permanent resident of Australia and my husband is a citizen. I heard that in our case, it's easy for my family to immigrate here, is that right?)

78. Family reunion in Australia can be complicated and expensive, which you may know already. How old is your mother?
(您也许已经知道了，澳大利亚的家庭团聚移民会比较复杂，而且费用很高。您母亲多大年龄呢？)

79. 我母亲结婚早，所以她现在也才 40 多岁。我丈夫也想尽力让我妈妈和姐姐过来。
(My mother got married young, so she's only in her early 40s now. My husband also wants to do everything he can to bring my mother and sister over.)

80. I see. What is the relationship between your husband and your mother like?
(我知道了。您丈夫和您的母亲关系怎么样？)

81. 我丈夫跟我家人之前在海外见过的，他们相处得很愉快的。
(My husband has met with my family overseas before, and they got along.)

82. Okay, the reason I asked is that the Australian Federal government is worried that old immigrants may become a burden. In other words, the government would like to make sure that the parent visa won't result in too much burden on the welfare system.
(好的。我这么问的原因是，澳大利亚联邦政府担心，年迈的移民会成为一个负担。换句话讲，政府想要确保，父母签证不会给福利系统带来过重的负担。)

83. 不会的，我母亲很健康，之前连说服她搬到这边都很难的。只要她在这边安顿下来，我们就会照顾她, 为她提供经济担保。
(It won't happen to us. My mother is quite healthy. It was even difficult to persuade her to move here. We'll take care of her and give her an Assurance of Support, as long as she settles down here.)

84. Okay, then you should apply as soon as possible, as the application may take as long as 20 years due to the long waiting time. Also, they'll have to pass the character test and go through an identification check.
(好的，那你要尽快申请了，因为要等很久，申请可能得耗时长达 20 年。另外，他们必须通过品格测试，以及完成身份核查。)

85. 为什么要进行品格测试呢？她们都是品格非常好的女性啊。
(What's the character test for? They are all women with perfect character.)

86. It's mainly for security reasons. Applicants may need to provide an overseas penal clearance certificate from each country they have visited. You can get this done at the embassy.
(这主要是出于安全原因。申请人要提供他们去过所有国家的海外无犯罪记录证明。你可以去大使馆开具证明。)

87. 好的。听起来很复杂，很费时间啊。
(Okay. It sounds quite complicated and time-consuming.)

88. There's also a permanent contributory parent visa, which is processed within 4-5 years. The total cost is over $40,000 for each parent. And they need to provide the Department of Home Affairs with files like their birth certificates and so on. So, the cost may grow.
(还有一个付费类父母移民签证，四到五年的时间就可以完成申请。总共费用是父母每人四万多澳币。你的父母还需要向内政事务部提供一些文件，比如出生证明等。所以，费用可能还会再涨。)

费用增加：The cost may grow, 也可以说 the cost may add on

89. 那真的很贵啊。不过，尽管如此，我们还是想让她们过来。
(That's really expensive. Despite the cost, we still want them here.)
