# 70069. Starting a food van business – Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking clerk of a local council and a mandarin-speaking newly-arrived migrant. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, I'm Simon. How can I help you today?  
(你好，我是西蒙。今天我能如何帮到你呢？)

2. 你好，西蒙。我和我的家人刚移民到澳洲，想做点小生意，这样我们就可以养活自己了。  
(Hello, Simon. My family and I have just migrated to Australia and we'd like to start a small business to support ourselves.)

3. That's a good idea. We have many services to support you. What kind of business do you mean?  
(这是个好主意。我们有很多服务机构可以帮助你。你想要做什么样的生意呢？)

4. 我想做食品生意。我想用货车卖咖啡和快餐。我的钱不多，租不起店面。我想，货车便宜一些。  
(I'm thinking about a food business, selling coffee and fast food from a van. I don't have much money and I can't afford to rent a shop. I guess a van is more affordable.)

Van: 货车(a medium-sized road vehicle, used especially for carrying goods, that often has no windows in the sides at the back)

5. No problem. Mobile food business is quite popular now and Australians love coffee.  
(没问题。移动食品生意现在很流行，而且澳大利亚人很爱喝咖啡的。)

6. 谢谢您。我想问问哪里可以看到更多的相关信息呢？有没有网上就可以看到的资料呢？  
(Thank you. I'd like to know where I can find more relevant information. Anything accessible online?)

7. All the information is available on government websites. Besides, you may want to meet some small business owners and seek advice.  
(所有的信息都在政府网站上了。你还可以认识一些小企业主，跟他们取取经。)

8. 好的。那请问如果我想学习一些相关的法律和税务知识，该怎么做呢？另外，我还需要申请税号和澳大利亚商业号。  
(Okay. What if I want to acquire some relevant law and tax knowledge, if I may ask? Besides, I need to apply for a tax file number and an Australian Business Number.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
必考重点词：TFN — tax file number 税号  
ABN --- Australian Business Number 澳大利亚商业号

9. These can be done by going to the Australian Taxation Office website. You'll need to create an account first and then link it with MyGov. After that, you'll see an icon in the top right corner. Click it and then all you need to do is to follow the instructions.  
(你可以用澳大利亚税务局的网站来完成这些。你需要先创建一个账号，然后跟"我的政府"绑定起来。之后你会看到右上角有一个图标，然后你点击进去，按照步骤做就好了。)

10. 好的。谢谢你。请问这个网站上有相关的法律要求吗？  
(Okay, thank you. Are there any relevant legal requirements on that website?)

11. Yes. There's also a checklist on the website so it's quite convenient for you to look up.  
(有的。网站上还有一个清单，方便你查阅。)

12. 太好了。感觉生活在澳洲很幸运。我迫不及待想开始了。谢谢您。  
(That's great. It's lucky to live in Australia. I can't wait to start. Thank you.)
