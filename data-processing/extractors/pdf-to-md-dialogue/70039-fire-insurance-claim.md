Hello，I'm Sarah from Golden Insurance. What can I do for you today?
您好，我是戈登保险的莎拉。我今天能为您做些什么呢？

2.
您好，我家不久前着火了，家具和电器都烧没了。我想申请理赔。
Hello. There was a fire accident at my place not long ago. All my furniture and electrical appliances have been destroyed. I'd like to make a claim.

3.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Could you tell me how the fire happened in detail?
很遗憾听到这个。您能具体跟我说说火灾是怎么发生的吗？

4.
那时候还是半夜，我们睡的正香呢，突然客厅的烟雾报警器就响了。我们急忙跑到房子外面去了。
It was in the middle of the night and we were in a sound sleep. All of a sudden, the smoke alarm in the living room beeped and we ran out of the property in a hurry.

5.
That sounds very scary. I hope everyone is safe and sound. Did the fire brigade tell you the reason of the fire?
听上去很吓人啊。我希望大家都平安无事。消防队告诉您火灾原因了吗？

6.
消防员说，是连接冰箱的那根线老化了, 然后就起火了。
According to the firefighter, the fridge cable was old and then the fire happened.

7.
I see. Let's start with your account details. I can see that you have purchased our home and contents insurance, so you can put your mind at ease that fire insurance claim is applicable to you. Did the entire house burn down?
我知道了。让我们从您的账号信息说起吧。我看到您买了我们的住宅和住宅内物品保险，所以您可以放心，您可以申请火灾保险理赔。是整个房子都烧毁了吗？

8.
我们的房子是双砖结构的, 没有烧毁。但是我客厅的地毯和厨房的橱柜都被烧了，还有我的鞋子和衣服都烧没了。我的猫也差点死了。
It's a double-brick house so it hasn't been burned down. However, the carpet in the living room and the cupboard in the kitchen have all been destroyed. Apart from that, all my shoes and clothes have been burned up and my cat almost died.

9.
It sounds so frustrating. Those things do happen sometimes. We'll process your claim as soon as possible.
听起来很令人沮丧啊。有时候就是会有这种事发生。我们会尽快处理您的理赔的。

自从火灾以后，我就搬到我姐姐家住了。我姐姐家离我上班的地方非常远，通勤非常不方便。能不能尽快付给我赔偿金呢？
I've moved to my sister's place since the fire accident and where she lives is very far from the place I work. Commuting is very inconvenient. I was wondering if I could get my payout as soon as possible.

11.
Unfortunately, we still need to do a fire damage assessment and send a fire assessor to your property. Your policy allows you to replace your damaged items with new ones of similar quality and cost. We'll also pay a portion of the compensation to replace your items. However, you need to pay the excess fee.
遗憾的是，我们还需要做一个火灾损失评估，并且派一位火灾评估员到您家去。您的保单可以让您把损坏物品更换成新的、相似质量和价格的物品。我们还会支付一部分赔偿金来帮您更换物品。不过，您需要付保险启动费。

12.
好的。我可以现在就支付。我希望我能尽快得到赔偿。谢谢你。
Okay, I can pay it now. I hope I can get the compensation as soon as possible. Thank you.
