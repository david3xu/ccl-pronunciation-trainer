#70162. Planning a Neighborhood Gathering - Social

1.
Hi! It's nice to see you drop by. Come on in! Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
你好！很高兴看到你过来！进来吧！你想来杯咖啡吗？

2.
你好呀。给我来杯咖啡吧！谢谢你！我有一个非常让人兴奋的想法，想跟你讨论一下。
Hi! I'd love a cup of coffee. Thank you! I have an exciting idea that I'd like to discuss with you.

3.
Wow, that sounds very intriguing! I'm interested. I love to hear exciting ideas. Why not sit down and have a chat with me?
哇，听起来很有趣！我很感兴趣。我很想听听你的想法。不如坐下来我们聊聊？

4.
昨天，我遇到一位女士。她刚搬到我家对面。我突然意识到，我对住在这里的很多人，都不太熟悉。
Yesterday, I met a lady who just moved in across from my home. I suddenly realized that I'm not very familiar with many people living here.

5.
Yes, you don't say. Loads of new people have moved here over the past six months. I don't know them either.
是啊，你说得对。过去六个月里有很多新搬过来的人，我也不认识他们。

6.
下周末，我们找一个下午，举办一个聚会吧？这样可以有一个不错的机会，让大家可以互相见见面，还可以吃点东西，喝点东西。
How about we organize a gathering one afternoon next weekend? It would be a great opportunity for everyone to meet, and we can have some snacks and drinks.

7.
It sounds fantastic. I think it won't be too difficult to organize this gathering. We can just do it casually. Let's do it next weekend.
听起来很棒！我觉得组织这个聚会不会太难。我们可以随意点。我们就下周末搞吧。

8.
好的。我想，现在最重要的事情是，我们可以告诉大家，那天下午有空了就可以来参加。不需要太正式。
Great. I think the most important thing now is to let everyone know that they're welcome to join that afternoon if they are free. It doesn't need to be too formal.

9.
I still have the decorations from my last party. We can use them. I don't think we need music at the gathering. After all, our main goal is to chat and connect with each other.
我还有上次聚会的装饰品。我们可以用它们。我觉得聚会不需要音乐，毕竟我们的主要目的是聊天和互相认识。

10.
没错。最重要的事情是让大家知道聚会即将举行。我们要尽快发邀请函。
Exactly. The most important thing is to let everyone know that the gathering is coming up. We should send out the invitations as soon as possible.

11.
That sounds really exciting! Once the invitations are ready, do let me know. I'll help you deliver them to everyone. And if I run into them, I'll be sure to mention it as well.
听起来真令人激动！一旦邀请函准备好了，记得告诉我。我帮你发给大家。如果我遇到他们，我也会告诉他们这件事的。

12.
我喜欢烹饪。我很乐意准备食物。我可能没有计划做什么特别的食物，就准备一些小吃吧。
I enjoy cooking, and I'd be happy to prepare some food. I might not plan anything special, just some snacks.

13.
We could go to the supermarket to get some supplies and drinks. I can't wait to make my favorite iced lemon tea.
我们可以去超市买一些材料和喝的东西。我迫不及待想做我最爱的冰镇柠檬茶了。

14.
太好了！谢谢你！这一定会很有趣！我很期待通过这个活动更了解我的新邻居们。
That sounds great! Thank you! This is going to be so much fun! I'm really looking forward to getting to know my new neighbors through this event.
