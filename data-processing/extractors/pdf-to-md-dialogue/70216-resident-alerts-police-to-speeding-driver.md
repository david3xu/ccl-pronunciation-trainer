#70216. Resident Alerts Police to Speeding Driver - Legal

1.
Hi. You've reached the police station. Constable Smith speaking. How may I assist you today?
你好！这里是警察局，我是史密斯警员。今天有什么能帮你的吗？

2.
您好，我要投诉我们公寓小区里有位司机开车一直超速。我们都觉得很危险。而且感觉车子发动机很强，非常吵。
Hi there, I'd like to report a driver in our apartment complex who keeps speeding. We all think it's really dangerous. Also, the car's engine seems really powerful and super loud.

3.
I hear you. People should drive slowly in an apartment complex, especially near kids' play areas or sidewalks. Where and when did the speeding happen?
我理解。大家在公寓小区里开车一定要慢点，尤其是在孩子玩的地方或人行道附近。超速是在什么地方、什么时候发生的？

4.
其实，我每天送孩子去学校的时候，都看到他车子飞速开过去。最近的一次发生在今天早上七点半左右，就在我们公寓小区门口。
Actually, every day when I take my kid to school, I see him speeding past in his car. The most recent time was around 7:30 this morning, right at the entrance of our apartment complex.

5.
That does sound risky. Do you happen to know the car's make and model, or any other identifying info?
听起来很危险。您知道那车是什么牌子、什么型号，或者还有其他辨识特征吗？

6.
是辆银色的车。车牌号我没看清，是我们小区一位年轻人开的。表情还非常嚣张呢。
It's a silver car. I didn't catch the license plate number, but it's driven by a young person who lives in our complex. And he always has this cocky look on his face.

7.
Thanks for that. Have you heard if anyone else has noticed this, or if this driver has been involved in any other incidents?
感谢您的信息。您知道有没有其他人也注意到这事，或者这个司机还有没有发生过别的事故？

8.
好多邻居都看到过呢，对他都快闻风丧胆了。他开车像疯了一样快，我们都很担心孩子们的安全。
Plenty of our neighbours have seen him too and are almost scared stiff of him. He drives insanely fast, and we're all really worried about the kids' safety.

9.
I understand. I'll dispatch a patrol car to monitor the area at those times, and if we can pinpoint the driver, we'll have a word with him.
我明白。我会在那个时段派巡逻警车去监控那个区域，如果我们能确认司机身份，我们会跟他谈谈的。

10.
谢谢警察同志。我们都希望他能明白这样做的后果，不要再超速了。我们想看到明显的改善。
Thank you, officer. We all hope he can understand the consequences of what he has done and can stop speeding. We really want to see some real improvement.

11.
We'll do everything we can to address this. If you spot anything like this again, please let us know immediately.
我们会尽全力处理。如果您再发现类似情况，请马上向我们报告。

12.
我会盯着他的。非常感谢你们的协助。我们真不希望每天送孩子的时候都捏一把汗啊！
I'll keep an eye on him. Thanks so much for your help. We really don't want to feel on edge every single morning when we're taking our kids to school.

13.
No worries. Our top priority is everyone's safety. Have a great day, and stay safe out there.
不客气。安全是我们的首要任务。祝您愉快，注意安全。

14.
谢谢。希望早点抓到那个坏蛋，给他点教训。如果还有任何情况，我会第一时间联系警局。
Thank you. I hope you can catch that troublemaker soon and teach him a lesson. If anything else comes up, I will contact the police immediately.
