#70210. Making Use of a Spare Skip Bin - Business

1.
Hey, long time no see! How are things shaping up with your new business?
嘿，好久不见！你的新生意做得怎么样？

2.
你好呀！刚开始的几个月，真的挺辛苦的，不过，好在生意现在开始红火了，跟之前比，现在我忙多了。
Hey! The first few months were really tough, but gladly business is getting busy now. Compared to before, I'm way busier these days!

3.
That's great news. I've been told the previous owner of this building left a ton of junk here when they left.
太好了。我听说这栋楼上一个房主搬走时，在这留下了一堆垃圾。

4.
确实，真让人头疼啊。我这阵子全心投入到生意里了，都没来得及顾这事呢。
Yeah, it's such a headache. I've been so wrapped up in the business that I haven't had a chance to deal with it.

5.
Actually, I could lend a hand. You probably saw that I got a skip bin delivered here last month.
实际上，我可以帮你一把。你可能看到了上个月我这送来一个大型垃圾箱。

6.
那么大的垃圾箱，我当然看到啦！你是打算用它清理仓库垃圾吗？你的垃圾肯定不少啊！
Of course I saw that huge skip bin! You're using it to clean out the warehouse, right? You must have a ton of junk!

7.
Funny enough, I don't. It turned out much bigger than I thought. It's only half full at the moment. Do you need to use it for your trash?
搞笑的是，我其实没多少垃圾。这箱子比我想象的大多了，现在才装了半箱。你要用这箱子扔你的垃圾吗？

8.
求之不得！谢谢你！我怀疑前一个业主压根没处理过垃圾，我能轻松就能把垃圾箱装满。
Perfect! Thank you! I doubt the previous owner never cleared the junk. I could easily fill this skip bin!

9.
Perfect! Make use of it! It'd be a shame to let it sit empty. Hiring it costs a lot!
太好了！赶紧用起来！空着不用太浪费了。租这东西可不便宜啊！

10.
我知道租大垃圾箱有多贵，特别是租一周的话。你要我帮你分担一下费用吗？或者我可以给你的车提供一次保养，来感谢你给我用垃圾箱，这帮我省掉了大麻烦。
I know how expensive it is to hire a skip bin, especially for a whole week. Want me to chip in? Or I could give your car a service as a thank you! — you just saved me a ton of hassle!

11.
I'd really appreciate your generous offer! Fantastic! My car's due for a service anyway, so that's perfect.
感谢你这么大方！太好了！我车本来也该保养了，这下正好。

12.
非常乐意效劳！哪天你方便了，把钥匙给我就行。不会花太久时间的。
Happy to help! Whenever it's convenient for you, just give me the car key. It won't take long.

13.
Thanks. Just say the word if you need a hand hauling the junk. I'll leave the skip bin here till the weekend.
谢谢。如果需要帮忙搬垃圾，跟我说一声。我会把垃圾箱留到周末。

14.
真是太感谢你能帮忙了。如果你方便的话，我现在就可以开始清理。
I really appreciate your help. If you've got time now, I can start clearing out right away.
