#70026. Hypertension and Cholesterol Medication - Medical

1.
How are you? Come in and take a seat. How can I help you?
你好吗？进来坐吧。我能怎么帮助你呢？

2.
医生您好。您能不能帮我再开一些高血压药和胆固醇的药呢？这些药我已经吃了六年了，快吃完了。
Hello, doctor. I want a new prescription for hypertension and cholesterol medicines. I have been taking them for six years and I have nearly finished all of these.

3.
Sure, but first when was the last time you had a Physical Exam, including a cholesterol and blood pressure check?
当然可以。不过首先我要问一下，你上次做体检，包括检查胆固醇和血压，是什么时候呢？

4.
我上个月做的体检。不过我是在国内做的。这是体检报告。
I had my physical examination last month, but it was in my own country. Here is the physical examination report.

5.
Okay. You said you have taken those medicines for 6 years, which is quite a long period of time. Have you brought the past prescriptions with you? I can look it up for you from our electronic databases.
好的，你说你吃这些药六年了，这个时间是很长的。你带了之前的处方吗？我可以从我们的电子数据库里面为你找一下。

6.
我带了，不过不是所有信息都是英文的。只有里面的有效成分是英文的。但是我想，澳洲医生应该看得懂。
I've brought them, but not all the information is in English. Only the active ingredients are in English. But I think Australian doctors should be able to understand them.

7.
That's fine. Let me have a look at your report. Your blood pressure is a bit high and your cholesterol level is still above the normal range. So I think you should continue taking your medication.
没关系。让我看看你的报告。你的血压有点高，胆固醇水平仍然高于正常范围。所以我认为你应该继续服药。

8.
好的医生。那我还应该注意什么吗？我平时的饮食需要改变吗？
Okay, doctor. Is there anything else I should pay attention to? Do I need to change my diet?

9.
Yes, you should reduce salt intake and eat more vegetables and fruits. You should also exercise regularly, at least 30 minutes a day. And avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
是的，你应该减少盐的摄入量，多吃蔬菜和水果。你还应该定期锻炼，每天至少30分钟。并且避免吸烟和过量饮酒。

10.
我不抽烟，也很少喝酒。但是我的工作很忙，没有太多时间锻炼。有什么简单的运动推荐吗？
I don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol. But I'm very busy with work and don't have much time to exercise. Do you have any simple exercise recommendations?

11.
You can try walking or swimming. Even climbing stairs can be good exercise. The most important thing is to be consistent and make it a habit.
你可以试试散步或游泳。甚至爬楼梯也是很好的运动。最重要的是要坚持，养成习惯。

12.
好的，我会试着改变我的生活方式。那我什么时候需要再来检查呢？
Okay, I'll try to change my lifestyle. When do I need to come back for another check-up?

13.
I recommend you come back in three months for a follow-up. We'll check your blood pressure and cholesterol levels again to see how you're responding to the medication and lifestyle changes.
我建议你三个月后回来复查。我们会再次检查你的血压和胆固醇水平，看看你对药物和生活方式改变的反应如何。
