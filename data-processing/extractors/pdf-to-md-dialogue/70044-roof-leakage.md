# 70044. Roof Leakage - Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between a mandarin speaking public tenant and an officer from the Department of Health and Human Services. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good afternoon, Mr. Yan. Sorry to have delayed setting up the meeting. Do you have any issues about your rental house?
(严先生下午好。很抱歉这次会谈安排晚了。您租的房子有什么问题吗？)

2. 谢谢，我住的房子有点问题。屋顶漏水了，真麻烦。我猜是排水沟被树叶堵住了。
(Thanks. There's something wrong with the house I live in. My roof is leaking. It's so annoying. I guess it's because the gutter has been blocked by leaves/has been clogged up with leaves.)

3. Oh, it's not pleasant when things like this happen in the middle of winter!
(哎，大冬天这种事发生真的是很烦人啊！)

4. 是啊。我给你们办公室打了很多次电话了，但是你们也没有派人过来解决问题。我该怎么办呢？
(Yes, tell me about it! I've called your office so many times. But you've never sent anyone. What should I do?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
"Tell me about it" is used to say that one understands what someone is talking about because one has had the same or a similar experience.

5. We will arrange our repairman to come to your house and have a look at your roof. Then we'll decide what action we should do to solve the problem.
(我们会安排我们的修理工上门查看一下您的房顶。然后我们再决定下一步该怎么做来解决问题。)

5. 谢谢。你们的修理工都有资质吗？我看了一下，我们周围有关修理的活儿啊，做的都不怎么样。
(Thank you. Are your repair people qualified? I have checked around the repair jobs done around us. They were not well done/They were not properly done./None of them were properly done./None of them were in good hands.)

6. All our repairmen are very experienced. They all have their ID and are authorized by us to solve the problem. There is no doubt they'll repair your roof in the best way.
(我们所有的修理人员都是经验丰富的。他们都有证件，由我们授权为您解决问题。毫无疑问，他们会用最优方案来修理您的屋顶。)

7. 太好了。我知道我们的费用是通过健康与人类服务部来负责的。作为低收入家庭，我们没有很多存款。所有的钱都用来养家糊口啦。而且，现在什么东西都很贵啊。
(That's great! I know the repair fees will be covered by the Department of Health and Human Services. As a low income family, we don't have much savings. All of our income has been used to support my family. Besides, everything is so expensive now!)

8. It may depend on the cause of the leakage, but the roof repair fee will be covered by the office. I will make a call to make sure when the repair man can come to your house.
(这要取决于漏水的原因了，但是房顶的维修费用是由我们部门/健康与人类服务部来负责的。我会打个电话，确认一下修理工什么时候来您家。)

9. 好的。我明天就在家里等着你们的电话。顺便说一下，我希望修理工不要在我的房子里面抽烟。
(Okay. I will wait for your call at home tomorrow then. By the way, I don't want the repairman to smoke at my house.)

10. No workers are allowed to smoke on the premises. You'll just need to make sure that they have access to the roof.
(我们的工人都是不允许在工作场所吸烟的。您只要确保他们能上到屋顶就可以了。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Premises, 用于复数的时候，表示 "the land and buildings owned by someone", 表示房屋连地基，办公场所，场地，不能只翻房屋。

12. 好的，没问题。谢谢你的帮助。
(Okay, no problem. Thanks for your help.)
