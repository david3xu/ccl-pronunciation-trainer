#70231. Designing a Relaxing Indoor-Outdoor Space - Business

1.
Hey there! It's been ages since we chatted last. I was just thinking about you the other day and wondering how things have been going on your end.
嗨！咱好久没聊天了。我前几天还在想你，想着你这边最近怎么样呀。

2.
是啊，好久不见了。我这段时间一直在翻新后院花园。现在终于大功告成，花草都种好了。
Yeah, it's been a while. I've been renovating my backyard garden recently. It's finally done, and the plants are all in place.

3.
That sounds awesome! Your garden redesign looked like a huge project. I hope it all turned out just the way you wanted.
听起来太棒了！你重新设计的花园看着真是个大工程。希望一切都按你想的那样完成了。

4.
挺顺利的。还好，我请的园艺团队很专业，帮我打理得很用心。现在，我在挑选户外家具。
It went really smoothly. Thankfully, the gardening team I hired was very professional and thorough. Now I'm picking out outdoor furniture.

5.
Picking the right plants and ornaments can get overwhelming. There are so many styles and colours to decide on.
选合适的植物和装饰品确实很累。风格和颜色有太多选择了。

6.
没错，我是先从花园的一角开始的。慢慢来，不用赶进度。我想让每个部分都很满意。
Exactly, I started with one corner of the garden. No rush—taking it slow. I want each section to be just right.

7.
Taking it step by step is smart. It gives you room to tweak things. Which corner of the garden are you focused on today?
一步一步来很明智。能让你有空去调细节。今天你在弄花园的哪个角落？

8.
我在设计让客厅可以通到外面新铺的露台，这样空间就比之前大多了。
I'm designing it so that the living room opens out to the newly built patio outside. In this case, the space is much bigger than before.

9.
Fantastic. In warm weather, you'll love the indoor-outdoor flow. Do you need more furniture to fill the extra room?
太棒了。天儿暖和的时候你会很喜欢那种里外贯通的感觉。你打算再添些家具来填补多出来的空间吗？

10.
是的，我们想放张户外沙发和几把躺椅，还打算在露台上放几件防水的家具。
Yes, we're planning to add an outdoor sofa and a few lounge chairs, and we're also thinking of adding some waterproof furniture to the deck.

11.
It's crucial that you'll love it for years to come. After all, you don't want to redecorate it again too soon.
关键是得弄完以后能喜欢很多年，毕竟不想没过多久就重装一次。

12.
我会选素净的灰色和棕色。然后用彩色抱枕、花盆来增添亮点，随时可以调整。
I'll pick neutral grey and brown colours. Then I'll add pops of colour with bright throw pillows and flowerpots. Easy to switch up anytime.

13.
I love that plan! Neutral bases with pops of colour are timeless. I'm really looking forward to checking it out when you're done.
我喜欢这个方案！素色底配亮色点缀永不过时。真期待等你完工后去参观。

14.
我也迫不及待想带你参观啦。不过还得等我把灯光和小配饰都摆好，大概要过两周。
I can't wait to show you around either. But I still need to set up the lighting and small decorations, so it'll probably be another couple of weeks.
