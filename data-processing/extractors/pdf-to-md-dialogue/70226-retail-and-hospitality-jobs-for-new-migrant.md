你好，我是新移民。我想找个活儿干。但是我不清楚，我的技能是不是可以帮我匹配到合适的岗位。
Hi, I'm a new immigrant. I'd like to find a job, but I'm not sure if my skills will match any suitable positions.

3.
Sure, that's exactly what we're here for! Tell me a bit about what you're good at or any jobs you've done before.
当然，我们就是干这个的！稍微跟我说说你擅长什么，或者以前干过什么工作吧。

之前，在国内，我在服装店卖过衣服，也在餐馆做过服务员端盘子。
Back home, I worked in a clothing store selling clothes and I also waited tables as a waitress in a restaurant.

5.
That's really useful experience! Retail and hospitality are big employers here in Australia, with lots of openings. Would you like to stick with those industries?
这些经验很有用啊！零售和餐饮业在澳洲招人很多，机会很多的。您想继续在这两个行业里找工作吗？

6.
这两个领域，我都可以的。主要是，我的英语还不太溜，我怕我干活儿的时候，沟通费劲。
I'm fine with both of these fields. The main thing is, my English isn't very smooth yet, and I'm worried that communication will be tough when I'm working.

7.
No worries. Lots of employers in these areas hire new migrants and are patient with language barriers. They might start you with simpler tasks.
别担心。这些行业的许多雇主都招新移民，对语言障碍也很包容。通常他们会先给你安排些更简单的活儿。

8.
他们格局还挺大。我愿意先从简单点儿的活儿开始。你能给我推荐几份合适的工作吗？
They are very open-minded. I'm happy to start with simpler tasks. Could you recommend a few suitable jobs for me?

9.
Let me have a look through our job listings. Since you're into retail and hospitality, I'll look for entry-level roles in those fields.
我仔细查查我们的岗位库。既然您对零售和餐饮业感兴趣，我找找这些领域里入门的岗位。

10.
非常感谢你。我想能尽快上岗，挣些钱养活自己，至少，让自己能吃饱饭。
Thank you so much. I'd like to start working soon and earn some money to support myself. At least put food on the table.

11.
I get that! Starting with an entry-level job is smart. You'll build local work experience and sharpen your English. Any other questions or concerns?
我懂。从入门级岗位开始干很明智，这样您能积累本地工作经验，也能练习英语。还有其他问题或顾虑吗？

12.
暂时没有了！真是太谢谢你的帮助了！回头，要是遇到什么麻烦，我再来请教您。
Not at the moment, thank you so much for your help. If I run into any problems later, I'll come back for your advice.
