#70194. Phone Inquiry about Electric Bike Rules - Legal+Business

1.
Hi, you've reached the police station. Are you calling about an emergency or do you need to report something non-urgent?
你好，这里是警局。您是因为紧急情况来电，还是有非紧急事件需要报案呢？

2.
你好，我没有紧急情况。我有点犹豫，不知道如果我不是来报案的，打个电话咨询一下是不是可以？
Hello, I don't have an emergency. I'm a bit hesitant about whether it's okay to call just to ask a question when I'm not reporting an incident.

3.
Don't worry about calling. During emergencies, we might be tied up, but it's quiet at the moment. I'm here to help.
电话咨询没问题。如果碰到紧急情况，我们可能忙不过来。不过，现在不忙。我很乐意帮忙。

4.
谢谢你。我儿子让我给他买一辆电动自行车。这样，他去朋友家就更方便了。但是，我不太放心。
Thank you. My son asked me to buy him an electric bike so that it is more convenient for him to go to his friend's place. But I'm a bit worried.

5.
Well, electric bikes have become very popular among teenagers, and parents love them as well, since they no longer have to drive their kids around.
嗯，电动自行车很受青少年欢迎，家长也很喜欢，因为这样他们就不用开车接送孩子了。

6.
对，我愿意给儿子买。但是，我对电动自行车的道路规定有些疑问。我试着在网上查了查，但是我感觉那些信息不是特别清楚。
Yes, I am willing to buy one for my son. But I have some questions about the road rules for electric bikes. I tried checking online, but I felt that the information was not very clear.

7.
Electric bikes follow the same general road rules as push bikes, but there are also a few special rules just for them.
电动自行车和普通自行车一样，都适用一般的道路规则。不过它们也有一些专门的规定。

8.
原来是这样。我不太清楚，我儿子骑电动自行车的话，是不是要像骑摩托车那样，需要考驾照。
I see. I'm not sure if my son needs to get a driver license to ride an electric bike, just like riding a motorcycle.

9.
No, he doesn't need one. Even though both vehicles have motors, they're categorized differently. Electric bikes don't need a license or insurance.
不，不需要。虽然这两种车都有电机，但是它们的类别不同。电动自行车不需要驾照或保险。

10.
我明白了，这样确实能简单点儿。不过，我在给儿子买电动自行车之前，还得考虑很多问题，毕竟，市面上电动自行车的选择实在太多了。
I see. That definitely makes things a bit simpler. However, there are still many factors to consider before buying him an electric bike. After all, there are so many options out there.

11.
Absolutely, there are plenty of options. I believe a dealer can really offer you some solid advice on picking the right electric bike.
确实，选择非常多。我觉得，经销商能给你一些挑选合适电动车的有用建议。

12.
有道理。我会确保我儿子熟悉电动自行车的道路规则的。我也会买一辆符合规定的车给他。
That makes sense. I will make sure my son is familiar with the road rules for electric bikes. I will also buy him a bike that meets the rules.

13.
Great, that's good to know. You can always check the government transportation website for all the road safety rules. I hope your son has fun riding and stays safe.
听到这个我很高兴。你可以在政府交通网站上查到所有道路安全规定。希望你儿子骑得开心，也能注意安全。

14.
太感谢了。警察同志，你真的是帮了我大忙。我非常感激你的耐心解答。这次通话解决了我的很多疑问。
Thank you so much. Officer, you have really helped me a lot. I really appreciate how patiently you answered my questions. This call has resolved many of my questions.
