1.
Good morning. Thank you for calling. What can I do for you today?
早上好，谢谢你的来电！今天有什么可以帮到你的？

2.
早上好！我有一个自己的生意。我想跟你聊聊，看看你能不能帮我处理一下我生意的会计方面的事情。
Good morning! I run my own business. I'd like to have a chat and see if you can help me with the accounting side of things.

3.
Of course. We're more than happy to help you. We specialize in business accounting. Could you let me know more about your business and the reason you may need an accountant?
当然，我们很乐意帮忙！我们专门做商业会计。你可以告诉我更多关于你的生意和你可能需要会计的原因吗？

4.
我开了一家电脑销售店。我一直都是自己做账的。但是，现在我处理不过来了。我需要会计的帮助。
I run a computer retail store. I've always done the bookkeeping myself, but now it's getting overwhelming. I need an accountant's help.

5.
That actually happens quite often among our clients. Hiring a professional accountant is definitely a great idea. It can help your business grow quickly and avoid more mistakes.
这种情况在我们的客户中很常见。找一个专业会计绝对是个好主意，不仅能让你的生意更快发展，也更能减少出错。

6.
我完全同意你说的。我也不想犯错误啊。但是我越忙，就越容易犯错。
I totally agree. I don't want to make mistakes either. But the busier I get, the easier it is to mess up.

7.
It's actually not hard to prevent that. A professional accountant can ensure your accounts are all in order. Do you have any urgent matters that need to be handled right now?
其实，这并不难避免。专业会计可以帮你把账目整理好。你现在有什么特别紧急的事需要处理吗？

8.
其实，还真的有。对于我来说，目前最紧急的事情就是所得税的申报。还有两天就要截止了。
Actually, yes. Right now, my biggest concern is filing my income tax. The deadline is in two days.

9.
Don't worry. If you have a professional accountant, there will be sufficient time. But you need to send all the relevant documents to our accountant in one go.
别担心，有专业会计的话，时间是够的。但你需要一次性把相关文件发给我们的会计。

10.
听你这么说，我真的松了一口气啊。我正在弄了。之前一年的情况其实都很好，但是最近两个月就特别紧迫。
I'm relieved to hear that. I'm working on it now. The past year was actually fine, but the last two months have been really hectic.

11.
Why don't we schedule a meeting to go through everything? We can also discuss what specific services you need.
我们约个时间详细过一遍吧？也可以讨论一下你具体需要哪些服务。

12.
听上去很完美，谢谢。我想我需要你帮我做所有的事情。我也想更新一下我这边的会计系统。
That sounds perfect, thanks! I think I need you to handle everything for me. I also want to get my accounting system updated.

13.
I'll discuss all the options with you. The right system for business accounting makes everything much simpler and faster.
我会和你讨论所有可选方案。合适的商业会计系统可以让一切更简单、更高效。

14.
太好了！这样的话，我就能把更多时间放在业务上，而不用担心账务问题了。我等你的安排，谢谢！
That's great! This way, I can focus more on my business without stressing over accounting. I'll wait for your arrangements—thank you!
