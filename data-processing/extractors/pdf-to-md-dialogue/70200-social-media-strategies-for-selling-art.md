#70200. Social Media Strategies for Selling Art - Business

1.
Hi! Welcome to our Business Support Open Day. How can I assist you today?
你好！欢迎参加我们的生意支持开放日，我今天有什么可以帮你的吗？

2.
你好。我是一名画家。我今天过来是想获得一些怎么拓宽销售渠道的建议。
Hi. I'm an artist and I've come here today looking for advice on how to broaden my sales channels.

3.
That's wonderful! Do you already have any of your pieces on the market?
太好了！您已经在市面上出售作品了吗？

4.
是的，我一般会在本地集市摆摊卖画，不过销售情况时好时坏。
Yes. I usually set up a stall at the local market to sell my work, but my sales are quite inconsistent.

5.
Got it. Have you tried selling your work through galleries? It's an approach many artists take.
明白了。您尝试过在画廊销售吗？许多艺术家都会这样做。

6.
这一点我其实也想到过。我有联系过几家画廊的。但是，他们抽的佣金实在太高了，就会导致我的利润很少。
I've actually thought about that before. I've reached out to a few galleries, but their commission rates are so high and it leaves me with barely any profit.

7.
I totally get that. Gallery commissions are no joke. They can be really steep. Have you ever thought about selling your work online? Online sales are booming right now.
我完全能理解。画廊抽成可不是闹着玩的，能贵到离谱。您有没有想过把销售转到网上呢？现在网上销售也很火。

8.
网上销售？我听说过，但是我没什么这方面的经验。您是指通过专门的平台或者网站吗？
Online sales? I've heard about it. But I don't have much experience with that. Do you mean specific platforms or websites?

9.
Well, you might want to begin by using social media platforms to connect with a broader audience. Plus, your buyers can get full transparency on what they're purchasing.
嗯，您或许可以先从社交媒体平台入手，来接触更广泛的受众。另外，你的买家也能非常透明地看到他们买的是什么。

10.
这个建议太棒了。在线上，客户能全方位看到我的作品，肯定更吸引人。我家里的油画和素描现在都堆成山了，根本没地方放了。
This advice is amazing! When clients can get the full perspective of my work online, that would be more appealing. My oil paintings and sketches are just piling up at home now with nowhere to go.

11.
You can also engage directly with potential buyers with the help of social media. Also, you can post updates whenever you want and showcase new work on a regular basis.
社交媒体还能让您直接跟潜在买家互动。而且，您可以随时发布更新和经常展示新作品。

12.
听上去很棒。在社交媒体上发帖，对我来说其实并不是那么复杂。但是我估计需要花点时间积累粉丝和互动。
That sounds amazing. Posting on social media isn't actually that complicated for me, but I guess it'll take some time to build a following and get engagement.

13.
I believe you'll nail it! Also, if you want to plan an exhibition or special event down the line, you can promote it via social channels too.
我相信你能做到的！而且，以后如果您想办个展览或特别活动，你也能用社媒渠道来宣传。

14.
谢谢你的夸奖！今天你给了我很多可行的思路和信心，真的是帮了我大忙！
Thank you for your kind words. You've given me a lot of practical ideas and confidence today. This has really helped me a lot!
