# 70058. Homework Club - Education

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Sandy, an English-speaking manager and a mandarin speaking volunteer who plans to set up a homework club. The dialogue starts now.

1. Please come in and take a seat. What can I do for you?  
(请进来坐吧。我可以为您做些什么呢？)

2. 桑迪小姐早上好。我发现很多孩子完成作业很费劲，所以我想为孩子们搞一个家庭作业俱乐部。  
(Good morning, Sandy. I found that many children have been struggling/have found it difficult to complete their homework, so I'd like to set up a homework club for them.)

4. 有的。我之前在一个家庭作业俱乐部工作了五年。 这个项目对学生非常有帮助, 尤其是来自难民家庭的学生。  
(Yes. I had worked for a homework club for five years and that program was very helpful to students, especially those from refugee backgrounds.)

5. That sounds wonderful. We need more volunteers to help with this club, as our existing projects have kept most of our staff occupied.  
(听起来很棒啊。鉴于我们大部分员工手头上的项目已经够忙了，这个俱乐部我们还得再找些志愿者帮忙。)

6. 是的，我们需要辅导各类科目的义工，像是英语，数学，物理，化学。  
(Yes. We need volunteer tutors in all subjects, such as English, math, physics and chemistry.)

7. Yes. Well, what would you do first if you were in charge of this program?  
(是啊。嗯，如果你来负责这个项目，你第一步会先怎么做呢？)

8. 如果我来负责这个项目，我会先找这些学生的家长和社区的领导见面讨论。我相信我们会找到足够的义工的。  
(If I were in charge, I would first meet and discuss with the parents of those students as well as community leaders. I believe that we'll find enough volunteers.)

9. Excellent! Can we organize this program within four weeks?  
(太好了！四周之内，咱们这个项目能办起来吗？)

10. 可以的。这一块我经验已经很足了。我相信我们的这个俱乐部也可以帮助到很多的中学生。  
(Yes. I've had rich experience in this field. I believe this club will help many secondary students.)

11. That's great! You can start by spending two hours every day preparing for this program. If the club is successful, we'll expand it in the future.  
(太好了！你可以先每天花两小时准备起来。如果俱乐部办的成功，以后我们再扩大规模。)

12. 太感谢你了。我想这个项目会帮助那些学生们赶上他们的同学的。  
(Thank you so much. I believe that those students will be able to catch up with their classmates with the help of this program.)
