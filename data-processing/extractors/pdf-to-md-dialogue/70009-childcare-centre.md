#70009. Childcare Centre – Education

1.
您好。我的大女儿现在三岁半了。我想把她送到你们的托儿中心。
Hi. My elder daughter is now three and a half years old. I'd like to send her to your childcare centre.

2.
We do provide long day care services for children aged 0-6. But unfortunately, there are no vacancies now. We can put your child's name on our waiting list.
我们确实为0-6岁的儿童提供全日制托管服务。不过，遗憾的是我们现在没有空位了。我们可以把你孩子的名字加到我们等候名单上。

3.
现在的托儿服务都太抢手了。我打了好几个电话。都是没有空位了。请问在你们中心排队要等多久呢？
The childcare services now are in high demand. I made quite a few calls and they all have no vacancies. May I ask how long the queue is in your centre?

4.
The average wait time is 1-2 years. Have you considered other types of care?
平均的等待时间是一到两年。您有考虑过其他的托儿服务吗？

5.
我联系过一些学前教育。但是如果我的女儿去他们那边，就拿不到政府的托儿补助了。
I have contacted some preschools. But we won't get the government's child care subsidy if my daughter goes there.

6.
That's correct. But they often charge half of our price, and we are both under the National Quality Framework. So are family day care, occasional care and outside school hours care services.
没错。但是他们的价格通常是我们的一半，而且我们都是遵守国家质量标准的。家庭日托，临时托管和校外时间托管服务也是一样。

7.
尽管如此，我还是愿意在你们的中心排队等待。我的邻居们都对你们的服务赞不绝口，说你们的早期儿童教育评级级别超过国家质量标准。收费也合理。
Despite all these, I'm still willing to queue in your centre. All my neighbors can't stop telling how great your service is/all my neighbors speak very highly of your service. They said your early childhood education has the rating of "exceeding National Quality Standard" and you have reasonable charges.

8.
Our intake usually takes place in late January when all the children start school. It's possible that some children ahead of you on the waitlist would cancel and then your child will get a place.
我们通常在一月末招生。那时候所有的孩子都上学了。也可能等候名单上排你们前面的孩子取消了，那你的孩子就有空位了。

9.
另外，我的小女儿上个月刚满一岁。是否她也要等两年呢？
Besides, my younger daughter just turned one year old last month. Does she also have to wait for two years?

10.
No. Our sibling priority policy can fast track your younger daughter's enrollment once your elder daughter is in our care.
不用的。您大女儿一入园，我们的兄弟姐妹优先政策就能快速跟进您小女儿入园。

11.
那太好了。那么，我们现在需要做什么准备吗？
That's great. Then... is there anything we could do now to prepare?

12.
If you fill out the enrolment form and pay a 50-dollar fee, I can put you on the waiting list.
如果您填好注册登记表并支付50澳币的费用，我可以把您加到等候名单上。

13.
好的。太谢谢您了。希望能很快等到空位。
Okay. Thank you so much. I hope there's a vacancy soon.
