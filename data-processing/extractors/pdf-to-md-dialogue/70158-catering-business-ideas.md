1.
Hello, I haven't seen you since you finished your business course. What a nice coincidence to see you here!
你好，你上完商业课程以后，我就没见过你了。真巧在这里遇到你。

2.
你好。是啊。我每天在这里为我的生意采购新鲜食材。我也很高兴见到你。
Hello. Yes, I come here every day to buy fresh ingredients for my business. I'm also very happy to see you.

3.
I'm really glad to see that you have your own business. How's your business going?
很开心你有了自己的生意。你的生意怎么样了？

4.
最近很好。我刚刚搬到一个大一点的场地，在一个大商场旁边。我需要一个更大的场地。
It's been going well recently. I just moved to a bigger place, next to a large shopping mall. I needed more space.

5.
That's exciting! I want to hear more about it. Do you have time to sit and talk with me?
那很让人激动啊。我想多了解了解。你有时间坐下来跟我聊聊吗？

6.
有。在我开始工作之前还有几分钟时间。我也想和你聊聊生意上的事。
Yes, I have a few minutes before I start work. I'd also like to talk to you about business matters.

7.
Good. I'm happy to help if I can. Do you need any advice on business ideas?
很好。如果我能帮到你的话，我很开心。你需要一些关于商业点子的建议吗？

8.
嗯。现在我接到更多晚宴订单。我有个想法，我可以为其他文化做传统美食。
Yes. I'm getting more orders for dinner events. I have an idea to make traditional dishes for other cultures.

9.
Do you know what culture you want to cook for? You may need to create a list of recipes and ingredients.
你知道你想做哪种文化的菜吗？你可能需要准备一个菜谱和食材清单。

10.
是啊，不过那会很有趣。我不确定是哪种文化。我需要发掘。
Yes, but it would be fun. I'm not sure which culture it will be yet. I need to explore that.

11.
A survey of your customers might help. You don't want to serve food your customers aren't interested in.
对你的客户进行调研可能会有帮助。你也不想提供他们不感兴趣的食物。

12.
有道理。我需要考虑一下再决定。做事情没必要匆匆忙忙的。
That makes sense. I need to think it through before deciding. There's no need to rush.

13.
You're in a good position. You're doing well, and you have time to think about the next step. Now you need to work.
你现在的情况很棒。你做得很好，而且有时间考虑下一步。现在你需要去工作啦。

14.
是的。我没时间了，不过我很高兴和你谈话。感谢你倾听我的想法。
Yes. I'm running out of time, but it's been great talking with you. Thank you for hearing my thoughts.
