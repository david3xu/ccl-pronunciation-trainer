#70220. Tenant Requests Pest Control - Business

1.
Hi, this is Tracy, your property manager. I got your voicemail and I'm just calling you back. Is everything okay?
你好，我是你的物业经理崔西。我收到你的语音留言，给你回电。请问一切都还好吗？

2.
你好。谢谢你这么快就给我回电话。我是新租客。我住的地方有些问题。
Hello. Thanks for calling back so quickly. I'm a new tenant. I'm having some issues at my place.

3.
I know you are a new tenant with our company, but it is best to notify us of any issues online, so we can have a written record.
我知道您是新租客，但您有任何问题，最好在网上告知我们，这样我们能有书面记录。

4.
哦，好的。我之前不知道，不过，您说的有道理。因为情况很紧急，我不确定该怎么办。
Oh okay. I didn't know that before, but what you said makes sense. Because this is urgent and I wasn't sure what to do.

5.
All notifications come to me straight away, so you can use our online system, even if the matter is urgent. So, tell me what's happening?
我立刻就能收到所有通知，所以就算紧急情况，您也可以使用我们的线上系统。那么，跟我说说您遇到什么问题了？

6.
今天早上，我有个工作会议。我去厨房准备早餐的时候，天还没亮呢。结果，我看到了一只老鼠！
This morning, I had a work meeting. When I went to the kitchen to make breakfast before sunrise, it was still dark outside. And then, I saw a mouse.

7.
Oh dear, that must have been disturbing to you. You haven't been leaving uncovered food scraps in the kitchen, have you?
天啊，这肯定吓到您了。您没有在厨房留下没盖好的食物残渣吧？

8.
当然没有啊。你知道的，我上周才搬进来。老鼠肯定早就在那儿了。老鼠这种动物太可怕了！
Of course not! As you know, I just moved in last week. The mouse must have been there already. Mice are such horrible creatures!

9.
Yes, you're right. They are not healthy, and they can also damage our homes. I will call the pest control company to help.
是的，您说得对。老鼠不卫生，还会破坏我们的房子。我会打电话给害虫防治公司来处理。

10.
谢谢，那太好了。我可不喜欢和那种有害的动物住在一起。它们可能传播病菌。
Thank you, that's great. I really don't want to live with those kinds of pests. They can spread germs.

11.
I understand. I'm sorry that no one noticed this problem before you moved in. But we will fix it quickly. I'll keep you updated.
我理解。很抱歉您搬进来前没人发现这个问题。但我们会尽快解决。我会随时让您知道进展的。

12.
感谢你。我不清楚害虫控制公司会怎么处理，希望我不需要搬出去。我才刚安顿下来。
Thanks. I'm not sure what the pest control will do exactly - I hope I won't have to move out. I've just settled in.

13.
No, I don't think so. For this type of pest, it's just a matter of removal. Hopefully, it won't take too long.
我觉得你不用搬的。这种害虫只需清除就行，希望不会花太长时间。

14.
好的，那我等你通知了。期待你早点告诉我害虫控制公司什么时候来。这样我可以安排时间。
Alright, I'll wait for your update. I'm hoping you can let me know soon when the pest control company will come, so I can plan my time.
