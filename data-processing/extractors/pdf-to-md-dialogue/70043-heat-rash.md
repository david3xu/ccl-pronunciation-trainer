#70043. Heat Rash - Medical

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place in a clinic between an English-speaking doctor and a mandarin-speaking patient. The patient is seeing the doctor regarding his blister and rash. The dialogue starts now.

1. Doctor：Good morning, Mr. Huang. You look unwell. What's the matter?
(黄先生，早上好。你看上去不太好，你怎么了？)

2. Mr. Huang：医生，从昨天开始，我身上就起红疹和水泡了，又疼又麻。
(Hello doctor, I've got rashes and blisters on my body since yesterday. It's numb and painful.)

3. Doctor：Let me have a look. Oh, you have heat rash!
(让我看看。呀！你起痱子了！)

4. Mr. Huang：天啊！有俗话说，如果身上疹子长成了一个圈，就活不了了，这是真的吗？
(Gosh! There's a saying that you'll die if the rashes make a circle around your body. Is that true?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
长成一个圈那个是带状疱疹(shingles)， 又名缠腰龙(不建议去搜图片)

5. Doctor：Don't worry. There is indeed an old saying. But you just have the rash because your skin cannot breathe very well during the hot weather.
(别担心。确实有句老话。但是你长疹子只是因为天气热，皮肤不透气而已。)

6. Mr. Huang：好吧。可是医生，我疼的要死，好像火烧和刀割一样，有什么办法缓解吗？
(Fine. But doctor, the pain is killing me. It feels like a burning pain and a stabbing pain. Is there a way to relieve/alleviate/ease the pain?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Burning pain 灼痛
Stabbing pain 刺痛
Relieve/ease/alleviate the pain 缓解疼痛

7. Doctor：In that case, I can prescribe you some anti-inflammatory medicine and some painkillers.
(这样的话，我可以给你开些消炎药和止痛药。)

8. Mr. Huang：好的医生，我这个疹子会传染吗？
(Okay, doctor. Are the rashes infectious/contagious?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
这里加了一句：那我就认命吧：I will take/accept it then.

9. Doctor：No, it's not infectious. It can itch a lot, but it's not dangerous. Scratching it could lead to an infection, though.
(不传染的。这疹子会让你觉得很痒，但是它并没有什么危险。不过，你要是挠它的话，可能会感染。)

10. Mr. Huang：那医生你能跟我老婆解释一下吗？我老婆因为这个，不让我进屋，也不让我接触孩子，也不让我碰她。她说这个会传染。
(In that case, could you explain this to my wife? I'm not allowed to be in the room or be with the children because of it. I'm not allowed to have body contact with her either. She said that it's infectious/contagious.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
In everyday English, people usually say that someone is not allowed to do something rather than someone is forbidden to do something.
这段加了一句"我老婆蛮不讲理"(My wife has been unreasonable/ridiculous).

11. Doctor：I'd be happy to talk to her. But we need to treat it carefully, because if the rash spreads, it will become more painful.
(我很乐意去跟她说一下的。不过这个需要小心医治，因为疹子扩散了会更疼的。)

12. Mr. Huang：我以前起过疹子，但是后来消了。这次我又起疹子了，我会不会以后一直得啊？
(I had a rash before, but it went away/disappeared later. Now I have a rash again. Will this be continual?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
"Continual" means "repeated many times, often in a way that is harmful or annoying."
"Continual" means start and stop, while "continuous" means never-ending.

13. Doctor：Heat rash occurs because your skin cannot breathe properly. However, it can be prevented if you expose your skin, wear thinner cloth and wash your body regularly.
(你会起痱子，是因为你的皮肤不太透气。不过，要是你能把皮肤多露出来些，穿薄点的衣服，并且经常洗澡的话，痱子还是可以预防的。)

14. Mr. Huang：最近我家在装修，到处都乱七八糟的，真烦人，应该就是这个原因。除了口服药，有什么外用药或者外敷药膏吗？
(My place is under renovation recently and it's been a mess everywhere. It's so annoying. That should be the reason. Apart from oral medication, are there any medicines for external use or ointment?)

15. Doctor：You can purchase an over-the-counter cream or spray from the Chemist. You also need to take anti-inflammatory medicine.
(你可以去药店买非处方药膏或者喷雾。你也需要吃消炎药。)

16. Mr. Huang：好的，麻烦您给我开消炎药，我之后就去药店。谢谢医生。
(Okay. Please prescribe me some anti-inflammatory medicines. I'll go to the pharmacy later. Thank you, doctor.)
