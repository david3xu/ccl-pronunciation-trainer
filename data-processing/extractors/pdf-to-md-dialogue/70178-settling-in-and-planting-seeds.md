#70178. Settling In and Planting Seeds - Social

1.
Hi, long time no see! How's everything going?
好久不见！最近一切都好吗？

2.
你好啊！搬到一个新国家，对一个家庭来说，确实是个很大的挑战。不过，我们真的很喜欢这里。
Hi! Moving to a new country is indeed a big challenge for a family, but we really love it here.

3.
That's good. I am glad to hear that. It's brave of you to move to a new country when you are not familiar with it.
太好了，我很高兴听你这么说。你在对这里还不熟悉的情况下，就搬来一个新的国家，真的很勇敢。

4.
即使我不熟悉这里，我们很兴奋，我想，等我们找到新朋友，孩子们也去上学了，我们就会觉得这边的生活舒适自由。
Even though I'm not familiar with this place, we're very excited. I think once we make new friends and the kids start school, we'll feel that life here is comfortable and free.

5.
I'm sure you will. I don't mind being your first friend. Let me know if you need help meeting people.
一定会的。我愿意成为你的第一个朋友。如果需要我帮忙认识新朋友，尽管开口。

6.
谢谢你！这很暖心。事实上，我想问下这附近有花园用品商店吗？
Thank you. That's so sweet. Actually, I'd like to ask if there are any garden supplies stores around here?

7.
It depends on what type of garden supplies you need. There are two gardening centres.
这要看你需要什么样的园艺用品。这里有两家园艺中心。

8.
我在自己国家有一个花园，我想买点种子，你觉得哪种种子好？
Back in my home country I had a garden, and now I want to buy some seeds. Which kind do you think is good?

9.
It depends on the weather. Some seeds grow very well. You can ask one of our neighbours.
这要看天气，有些种子长得特别好。你可以问问我们的邻居。

10.
啊，那好的。我还没见过他呢。如果我想跟他聊聊园艺的事儿，去敲他的门，会不会冒昧啊？他会介意吗？
Ah, alright. I haven't met him yet. If I want to talk with him about gardening and knock on his door, would that be too forward? Do you think he'd mind?

11.
No, not at all. I can introduce you to him if you like. He has a good garden, and he knows where to buy seeds.
不会的，完全不会。如果你愿意，我可以把他介绍给你。他的花园打理得很好，也很清楚哪里可以买到种子。

12.
太好了！我很好奇在不同国家，不同气候，能种些什么种子。
Great! I'm really curious about what kinds of seeds can be grown in different countries and climates.

13.
Let me know if you start. I can help you if you like. Keep me posted! I've got spare tools you can borrow.
如果你开始动手，告诉我一声。如果你需要，我可以帮忙。随时告诉我进展！我有多余的工具可以借给你。

14.
谢谢，我很感激你的帮忙，我很高兴能在这里种菜。能继续园艺的爱好，也让我对新生活充满了期待。
Thank you, I really appreciate your help. I'm so happy to be able to grow vegetables here. Continuing my passion for gardening makes me look forward to my new life.
