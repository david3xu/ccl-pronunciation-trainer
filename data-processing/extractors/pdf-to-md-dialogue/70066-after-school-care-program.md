# 70066. After-school-care program- Education

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Jenny, an English-speaking staff member of an After School Care program and a mandarin-speaking parent. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, this is Jenny, the head of the After School Care program. What can I do for you today?  
(你好，我是珍妮，我是校外时间托管的负责人。今天我可以为您做些什么呢？)

2. 你好，珍妮老师，我想帮我的女儿报读一个校外时间托管的项目。  
(Hello, Jenny, I'd like to sign up for an After School Care program for my daughter.)

3. Well, you've come to the right place. Do you mind if I ask how old your daughter is? I'll try my best to find the most suitable activities for her.  
(那您就来对地方啦。我可以问一下，您女儿多大了吗？我一定会帮她找到最适合她的活动。)

4. 她七岁啦。我担心她一个人会很孤独。而且，她还有一点内向。  
(She's seven years old. I'm concerned that she may feel lonely on her own. Besides, she's a bit introverted.)

5. You can put your mind at ease. Our service is a very social place and children really enjoy the opportunity to play and chat with each other outside of the classroom setting.  
(您不用担心的。我们中心非常适合孩子们交朋友。而且，能跟学校课堂之外的孩子们一起玩，一起聊天，孩子们也非常开心呢。)

6. 那太好啦！ 我也希望她可以交点新朋友呢！对啦，我一般是下午 5 点下班，但是我没办法保证我能一直在同一个时间来接她。请问这样可以吗？  
(That's great! I really hope she can make some new friends. By the way, I usually get off work at 5:00 pm but I can't promise to pick her up always at the same time. Is that okay, if I may ask?)

7. Don't worry. Some of our parents pick up their children at different times every day.  
(别担心啦。我们这有些家长每天也是在不同的时间接孩子的。)

8. 那我就放心啦。有时候，我可能工作结束的比较晚。我可以让我母亲来接她吗？  
(That's a relief. Sometimes I may finish work late. Is it okay if my mother picks her up?)

9. That's totally fine. However, you do need to let us know beforehand because it is crucial that all of our children are safe no matter where they are.  
(没问题的。不过，您一定要提前通知我们。因为不管孩子们在哪，他们的安全都是至关重要的。)

10. 听您这么说我真的放心啦。您现在可以帮我女儿报名吗？  
(I'm really relieved to hear that. Could you sign my daughter up for the program now?)

11. Sure! Our service is full of fun options for your daughter and I'm sure she'll be having fun and keeping safe in this friendly environment.  
(没问题的。我们会为你女儿提供非常多好玩的活动的。我相信她在这个友善的环境里一定会很开心很安全。)

12. 太好了，我非常期待。珍妮老师，非常感谢你今天的帮助！  
(Great! I'm looking forward to it. Thank you for your help today, Jenny!)
