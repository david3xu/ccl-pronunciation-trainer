# 70067. A nasty cold - Medical

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between William, an English-speaking doctor and a mandarin-speaking patient. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hello, I'm William. What seems to be the trouble?
(你好，我是威廉。你怎么了？)

351. 你好医生。我三周以前就感觉不对劲了。我现在也不舒服。我吃了治感冒和流感的药，还吃了维生素，但是都不管用。
(Hello, doctor. Something didn't feel right for me three weeks ago and now I still feel unwell. I've taken cold and flu medicines as well as vitamins, however, none of them worked.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
None of 后面，加单复数皆可，不过口语中多用复数。但是, 如果后面的名词不可数，那么谓语动词要用单数。比如：None of us have/has ever been ill. None of the money was paid to me.

3. Okay. I'll give you a check-up. Feel free to let me know if anything feels unusual.
(行，我给你检查一下。如果哪儿觉得不对劲，尽管告诉我。)

352. 我一直咳嗽和打喷嚏。我喉咙也很痛。我觉得我可能是得流感了。
(I keep coughing and sneezing and I've also got a sore throat. I think I may have the flu.)

5. It should be a cold rather than the flu. Otherwise, your symptoms would have been worse. Have you been resting well lately?
(应该是感冒，不是流感。要不然，你的症状应会更严重的。你最近休息得好吗？)

353. 不太好。我不知道感冒能这么严重。会不会传染给孩子们啊？
(Not really. I didn't expect that a cold could be so severe. Will it be passed on to my kids?)

354. Well, a cold can also be quite nasty, especially when you've not been resting well. Cover your mouth when you sneeze or blow your nose, and make sure to wash your hands afterwards. In that case, your kids won't be infected.
(感冒也会是很严重的，尤其是你休息不好的时候。你在打喷嚏或者擤鼻涕的时候，要遮住嘴巴。之后记得洗手。这样就不会传染你的孩子了。)

355. 好的，我知道了。我在办公室工作，我也不想传染给别人。
(Okay, I'll keep that in mind. I work in an office, so I don't want to pass it on to others either.)

356. In that case, you should stay home and rest until your symptoms are gone.
(那样的话，在你的症状消失以前，你应该在家休息。)

357. 如果我说我感冒了， 我老板会相信我吗？我怕丢工作啊！
(Will my boss believe me if I say I have a cold? I'm afraid of losing my job.)

358. Don't worry. I'll give you a sick note so that you can stay home.
(不用担心，我给你开一个病假条，这样你就可以呆在家里了。)

359. 我不知道你还能这样做呢！谢谢你医生！
(I didn't know you could do that. Thank you doctor.)
