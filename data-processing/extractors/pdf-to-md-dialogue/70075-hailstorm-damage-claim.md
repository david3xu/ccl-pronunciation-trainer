# 70075. Hailstorm Damage Claim-Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between Jenny, an English-speaking claim officer from Sunshine Insurance company and her client. Jenny is at her client's house to assess the broken windows caused by a hailstorm. The dialogue starts now.

1. Good morning. I'm Jenny from Sunshine Insurance. I came here today to assess your hailstorm damage.

(早上好，我是阳光保险的珍妮。我今天是来评估一下雹暴给您造成的损失。)

2. 你好珍妮。这次的冰雹实在太恐怖了。昨天晚上，我填写了理赔申请表。谢谢您这么短的时间就能赶过来。

(Hello, Jenny. The hail this time is so horrible. I filled out the claim form last night. Thank you for coming at such short notice.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
At/on short notice: 固定搭配, 表示"在短时间内"

3. You are welcome. Our company always helps our clients to process their claims as fast as possible.

(不客气。我们公司一直都是尽快帮我们的客户处理理赔的。)

4. 真是感谢你！天气预报说，这周晚些时候还会有暴风雨，我很担心会造成更近一步的损失。我带你去看看碎掉的窗户吧, 它们都在厨房里。

(Thanks a lot. According to the weather forecast, there will be a storm later this week. I'm worried that it will cause more harm. I'll show you the smashed windows. They are all in the kitchen.)

5. Okay…I can see that three big windows were smashed and there are cracks on the other two small windows. This is really bad.

(好的，我看到三扇大窗户碎了，另外两扇小窗户有裂痕。这很糟啊。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Cracks: 名词，裂痕，裂缝。

6. 是呀。从碎掉的窗户里进来的雨水弄坏了我的地板。地板现在都泡在水里了。

(Yes. The floor is damaged by the rain coming from the smashed windows. It's now soaked in water.)

7. Yes, we had received a lot of calls about the damages caused by the hailstorm. They also have problems with damaged windows and roofs.

(是啊，很多人打电话给我们，都是因为冰雹带来了损失。他们也是有窗户和屋顶损坏的问题。)

8. 真的很可怕。我从来没有见过这么大的冰雹。当时风在怒吼，我还很担心我的屋顶会被弄坏呢。好在一切都过去了。

(It's really horrible. I had never seen such large hailstones. The wind was howling, and I was so worried that the roof might be broken. Luckily, it's all over.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
Hailstones: 雹子, 雹块，常用复数(a small ball of ice that falls like rain)
Howl: 动词，狂风呼啸。

9. That's very lucky of you. I'll arrange someone to block up the windows for you. Once your claim has been processed, we'll arrange a proper repair.

(您真的是很幸运了。我会安排人来把窗户封上。等您的理赔开始处理以后，我们会安排人好好维修的。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】
If you block something up, it's blocked completely so that nothing can get through it.
封上，堵上。

10. 太好了！我不想我的房子再进水了。您觉得保险公司会接受我的理赔吗？

(That's great! I don't want my house to be water-damaged anymore. Do you think the insurance company will accept my claim?)

11. I can't say for sure, but I believe it wouldn't be a problem. Your policy does cover damages caused by hailstorm. I will notify you once we have the result of your claim within seven days.

(我不能说百分之百确定，但我相信应该不成问题。冰雹造成的损失确实是包含在您的保险单里的。七天以内，您的理赔一出结果，我就通知您。)

12. 好的。我等你回复。我真希望保险公司能接受我的理赔。你真是帮了我大忙啊！谢谢你珍妮。

(Okay. I'll wait for your reply. I really hope the insurance company will accept the claim. You've been very helpful. Thank you, Jenny.)
