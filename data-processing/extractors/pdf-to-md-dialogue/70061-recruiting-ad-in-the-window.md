# 70061. Recruiting ad in the window– Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place between an English-speaking clerk in a café and a Mandarin-speaking woman, who just walked into the café after seeing a recruiting ad in the window. The dialogue starts now.

1. How are you? Please take a seat. May I get you a cup of coffee or would you like to see our menu?  
(您好吗？请坐吧！您是想来杯咖啡呢，还是看一下我们的菜单呢？)

2. 不用啦，谢谢你。我想申请一下窗户上的那份工作。  
(I'm good. Thanks. I was wondering if I could apply for the job posted in the window.)

I was wondering if…是委婉礼貌提问的一个句式；  
回答说"不用了"，除了"No", 是否有听到 local 讲"I'm good"呢？这也是一种地道的表示"不用了"的说法哈。但是不要记成"I'm fine"或者是"good"。

3. Yes, I can also help you with that. I'm the manger here and my name is Rachel. What would you like to know about the job?  
(好，这个我也可以帮你。我是雷切尔，是这的经理。关于这份工作，你想了解些什么呢？)

4. 谢谢你。我想了解一下，这份工作都包括什么呢？是全职还是兼职呢？  
(Thank you. I'd like to know what the job includes. Is it part time or full time?)

5. Well, we're looking for someone who can work for 5 days a week, from Monday to Friday, 9:00am to 3:00pm. Do you think you are available during the time slot?  
(嗯，我们希望能招一个一周可以工作五天的员工。工作时间是周一到周五，早上九点到下午三点。这个时间段你可以吗？)

6. 可以可以！我已经找全职工作找了一阵子了。我对这个工作很感兴趣的。我很愿意在那个时间段上班的。这个时间也很适合我。  
(Yes, definitely! I've been looking for a full-time job for a while and I'm really interested in this one. I'd love to work during that time slot and the time suits me.)

7. That's great! Do you have any related work experience? Have you worked in a café or restaurant before?  
(太好了！你有相关的工作经验吗？你之前在咖啡厅或者餐厅工作过吗？)

8. 有的。我之前在一家饭店做过帮厨，我也做过服务员。我还在一家做早午餐出名的餐厅做过咖啡。我还在一家很忙的早餐店工作了三年呢。  
(Yes. I once worded as a kitchen helper/a kitchen hand in a restaurant and I've also worked as a waitress. Apart from that, I once worked as a barista in a restaurant famous for its brunch and I've also worked for three years in a busy breakfast joint.)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Joint, 俚语，在这里表示像是 a place/location such as a bar, café 等等的地方。

9. That's great experience. We can have a trial shift this Wednesday if you are available. Could you email me a copy of your resume? If it looks okay, I'd like to see you working for a few hours.  
(这些工作经验都很棒。如果这周三你有空，我们可以先试个工。你能发一份你的简历到我的邮箱里吗？如果简历可以，我想让你试工几个小时看看。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Trial，多义词，在这里表示试验；  
Shift，多义词，在这里表示轮班。比如 early shift, 早班。所以 trial shift 是试工。

10. 可以的！我今天上午就可以发给你。我家住的不远的。我一会儿就能到家了。请问，我要发到哪个邮箱呀？  
(Sure! I'll send it to you before noon. I live quite close and I'll be home soon. Which email address should I send it to, if I may ask?)

11. Here's my email address. Could you include your phone number in the resume, so that I can give you a call later today?  
(这是我的邮箱。你能把电话号码也放到简历里吗？这样今天晚些时候我可以打电话给你。)

12. 好的！非常感谢你呀！期待晚些时候能接到你的电话！  
(Sure. Thank you so much. I'm looking forward to your call later.)
