#70240. A New Creamy Leather Lounge Chair - Business

1.
Hey, great to see you! We've finally got a chance to catch up.
嘿，好高兴见到你！我们终于有机会聚一聚了。

2.
对啊，咱们好久没坐下来慢慢喝咖啡聊聊天了。
Yeah, it's been ages since we last sat down to enjoy coffee and chat.

3.
How's your day going? You mentioned you were browsing the mall before coming here to meet me.
你今天过得怎么样？你说你来这跟我见面之前还在逛商场呢。

4.
对，我就是想买把新休闲椅，所以一直在商场里逛，想挑个质感好的。
Yeah, I just want to buy a new lounge chair, so I've been looking around the mall for one that feels really nice.

5.
That's awesome. Big stores have loads of options. But furniture can be expensive, depending on what you want.
那太好了。大商场的选择多得很。不过家具可不便宜啊，这要看你想要什么样的了。

6.
我看上了一款奶油色皮质沙发，很对我胃口，可价格不算低。我不太确定最划算的付款方式是怎样的。
I spotted a cream-colored leather sofa that I really like, but it isn't cheap. I'm not sure which payment method makes the most sense.

7.
You could go with one of those 'Buy Now, Pay Later' services. Nowadays almost every store offers them.
你可以选择那种'先买后付'服务，现在几乎所有店都有这种选项。

8.
要是可以分次付款，就太棒了。这样的话，我就能立刻把皮沙发搬回家了。
It'd be great to split the payment, then I could take the leather sofa home right away.

9.
True, but watch out for extra fees, and skipping an installment payment could affect your credit score.
没错，不过要留意额外费用，漏交一笔分期付款还可能影响你的信用记录。

10.
我知道对于这种'先买后付'要谨慎点，可是感觉挺适合我的。毕竟，我只买这一件东西。
I get that 'Buy Now, Pay Later' needs caution, but I feel it might work well for me. After all, I'm only buying this one thing.

11.
It's smart to think about your best payment options for big purchases. You could save money or make it easier to pay.
考虑一下大额消费的最佳付款方式是明智的。你可能可以省钱，或者让付款更轻松。

12.
我也这么觉得。我今晚好好比对一下，再明天去店里决定。我觉得这沙发放客厅肯定很棒。
I agree. I'll carefully compare them tonight and decide at the store tomorrow. I bet that sofa would look fantastic in the living room.

13.
Creamy leather sounds a perfect choice. How about we grab a slice of cake with our coffee to celebrate?
奶油色的皮革，这选择听着太完美了。要不咱俩喝咖啡时再加块蛋糕，庆祝一下？

14.
听起来很完美。我逛完这一圈，肚子都饿扁了。希望一切都顺利。
Sounds perfect. I'm starving after all that shopping. Hope it all works out.
