#70020. Separation - Legal

1.
Good morning, Mrs Wang. I know you want to enquire about the separation with your husband, is that right?
早上好，王太太。我知道您想咨询您和您丈夫分居的事情，是吗？

2.
是的，我和我的丈夫没法再生活在一起了。过去的一年中，我们每天都在吵架。我累了，他也累了。
Yes. I can't live with my husband any more. During the past year, we have been fighting every day. I am tired. He's tired, too.

3.
Before we go to the process of the formal separation, may I suggest both of you go to the marriage counselling resolution program first.
在我们进入正式的分居程序之前，我会建议你们二人先去参加婚姻咨询调解项目。

4.
你是说让我们参加婚姻调解项目吗？我觉得我丈夫不愿意参加，我也没有办法，这不是一个人的事。
Are you saying that you want us to go to the marriage resolution program? I don't think my husband is willing to go. There's nothing I can do. I have no control over this. This's not my own business.

5.
I see. May I ask how long you have been married? Do you have any children?
我知道了。请问，你们结婚多久了？你们有孩子吗？

6.
我们结婚十年了，有一个女儿，八岁。我想问，分居以后可不可以我来带女儿？我的丈夫不太会照顾孩子。
We have been married for 10 years. We have a daughter and she's 8 years old. I'm wondering if I can take care of my daughter after the separation. My husband is not good at looking after children.

7.
The process will be straightforward if you both agree to the separation. If not, under the Parenting Law, if your child is under 18, both of the parents should share the parental responsibility. Is your husband aware of the decision of separating?
如果你们俩都同意分居，程序就会很直接。如果不同意的话，根据《父母责任法》，如果您的孩子未满18岁，父母双方应该共同承担父母责任。您丈夫知道分居的决定吗？

8.
我没有跟他提过，就是因为这个原因，我今天先来咨询律师。你们可以帮我们起草分居协议吗？我们的房子是一起买的，我想把房子卖掉。
I haven't talked to him about it. That's exactly the reason I came to consult with a solicitor first today. Can you help us draw up a separation agreement? We bought our house together. I want to sell the house.

9.
We can help you draft the separation agreement. However, we need both parties' signature on the agreement. Before we draft the agreement, you should notify your husband about your intention to separate first.
我们可以帮您起草分居协议。但是，我们需要双方在协议上签字。在我们起草协议之前，您应该先通知您丈夫您想要分居的意图。

10.
好吧，我知道了。那如果分居一年以后，我们想要离婚，需要什么程序呢？
Okay, I see. If we want to get divorced after being separated for a year, what procedures do we need?

11.
You need to apply for a divorce through the Federal Circuit Court. You need to prove that you have been separated for 12 months and your marriage has irretrievably broken down.
您需要通过联邦巡回法院申请离婚。您需要证明您已经分居12个月，并且您的婚姻已无法挽回地破裂了。

12.
谢谢您的建议。我会先和我丈夫谈谈分居的事情，然后再回来找您。
Thank you for your advice. I'll talk to my husband about the separation first and then come back to see you.
