#70015. Intercom Repair - Housing

1.
Good morning, this is Jean from community housing service. How can I help you today?
早上好，我是小区物业服务处的珍。今天我能帮您些什么呢？

2.
早上好，我叫李桂英。我家楼下入口的对讲机坏了两个月了。我也报修过了。但是一直都没有人来修。
Good morning. My name is Guiying Li. The intercom at the entrance of my building stopped working two months ago. I have reported/asked for repair/put in a repair request, but no one ever showed up.

3.
I see. Did you report it by giving us a call or by talking to us in person? Do you have a customer reference number?
我了解了。您报修的时候是给我们打的电话，还是亲自来找的我们呢？您有客户参考编号吗？

4.
我是打电话报修的。确实你们的工作人员给了我一个编号。让我看看，是F3872。我家在二楼，我腿脚又不利索，没有对讲机真的很不方便。
I gave you a call. Your people did give me a number. Bear with me…it's F3872. I live on the second floor. My legs are not working properly/smoothly/I have mobility issues and it's really not convenient without the intercom.

5.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Let me check our records first. Can I confirm that the building is Unit 6, 56 Bond Street, Parramatta?
对于给您带来的不便，我很抱歉。让我先看看我们的记录。是巴拉玛塔区，邦德街56号的6单元吗？

6.
是的没错。我8月5号报修的。因为8月3号是我74岁生日，我朋友来给我庆祝，结果我没办法给他们开门。我记得很清楚。
Yes. I reported on the fifth of August. August the third was my 74th birthday and my friends came to celebrate for me. I was not able to open the door for them. I remember that clearly.

7.
Congrats on your birthday! Well, I can see from the system that we did send a handyman to repair the intercom. He contacted you twice, yet it seems you didn't pick up his calls. Have you changed your phone number?
祝贺您啦！嗯，我可以从系统里看到，我们确实派了一名杂务工去修对讲机。他联系了您两次，但是似乎您没有接他的电话。您换电话号码了吗？

8.
电话号码我是不会换的，要不然朋友找不着我了。不过我可能确实没有接他的电话，我看到是个不认识的号码，以为是推销的。你知道现在好多推销的人实在太烦了，接了电话简直就别想挂电话。
I won't change my phone number because otherwise my friends would not be able to reach me. However, it was possible that I didn't pick up his call. I saw it was a new number and I thought it was a telemarketer. You know, many of them are so annoying. You can never hang up after you pick up their calls.

9.
I totally understand. I will arrange our contractor to fix the intercom. His name is John Brown. His number is 0401 247 638. You may want to save his number this time. I'll make an appointment for you now. What about next Monday morning？
我完全理解的。我会安排我们的合同工去修对讲机的。他的名字是约翰布朗。他的电话号码是0401 247 638。这次您也许需要把他的电话号码存起来啦。我现在再帮您预约一下吧。下周一早上让他来怎么样？

10.
早上可能不行，那天早上我要去医院，下午要去学校接孙子放学。
Morning is probably not okay. I have to go to the hospital that morning and I need to pick up my grandson from school that afternoon.

11.
Well, I'll put this in the system. What about 12:30? John will contact you an hour before he arrives. Is that okay for you?
嗯，我会在系统里标注一下的。那12:30呢？约翰会在到之前提前一小时联系您的。可以吗？

12.
好的，到时候我会在家等着的。谢谢你耐心的帮助。再见。
Okay. I'll wait at home then. Thank you for your patience. See you.
