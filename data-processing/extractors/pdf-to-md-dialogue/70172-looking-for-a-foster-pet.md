#70172. Looking for a Foster Pet - Social

1.
Good morning! Welcome to the animal shelter. Let me know how I can help you today.
早上好！欢迎来到动物收容所。我今天能怎么帮助你呢？

2.
你好，我经常从这里路过。我看到你们门上贴了关于小猫和小狗的领养海报。
Hi! I walk past here quite often. I saw some adoption posters for kittens and puppies on your door.

3.
I can introduce you to our adoption options, whether you're interested in a dog, a cat, or even a bird. We also have some rabbits at the moment.
我可以给你介绍我们的领养选项，你可以选择狗、猫，甚至是鸟。我们现在还有一些兔子哦。

4.
我现在还不能正式领养宠物，但是我可以暂时照看动物。
I can't officially adopt a pet right now, but I can foster animals temporarily.

5.
That's also great! Temporary fostering helps us a lot. It's also beneficial to the animals, but we expect you to commit to it for at least one month.
那也太棒了！临时寄养对我们帮助很大，对动物们也很有好处。但我们希望你至少能照顾一个月。

6.
我很乐意照顾动物一个月。但是我不知道猫还是狗更适合我。
I'd love to foster for a month. But I'm not sure whether a cat or a dog would be a better fit for me.

7.
Dogs and cats have different needs. It depends on your living situation and personal preference.
猫狗的需求不太一样，这主要取决于你的生活环境和个人喜好。

8.
我和我的老父亲住在一起，我们都喜欢狗。不过，我的父亲拄着拐杖，我们不能照顾太活泼的狗。
I live with my elderly father, and we both love dogs. But my father uses a cane, so we can't handle a dog that's too energetic.

9.
Even though some well-behaved big dogs are great companions, they may not be ideal for the elderly or those with mobility issues. A small dog might be a better choice.
尽管一些性格温顺的大狗很适合作伴，但它们可能不太适合老人或者行动不便的人。一只小狗可能会更合适。

10.
小狗更容易遛。我在你们的海报上看到了一只毛茸茸的小狗。
Small dogs are easier to walk. I saw a fluffy little dog on your poster.

11.
Yes, I know which dog you're talking about. It's well-behaved and would be a good fit for you and your father.
对，我知道你说的是哪只狗。它很乖，应该很适合你和你父亲。

12.
太棒了！我想领养它。我需要办理什么手续？虽然我不太了解具体流程，但我很开心能做这件事。
This is amazing! I want to adopt it. What paperwork do I need to complete? I'm not too familiar with the process, but I'm really happy to do this.

13.
You need to fill out an application form first. Once that's done, we will conduct a home visit to ensure your living environment is suitable for a dog.
你需要先填写一份申请表。填好后，我们会进行一次家访，来确保你的居住环境是适合养狗的。

14.
我明白了，没问题。我可以现在就填表格！我很期待和父亲一起照顾这个小家伙。
Got it, no problem! I can fill out the form right now. I'm really looking forward to taking care of this little one with my father.
