#70207. Pitching Baked Goods to a Café - Business

1.
Welcome inside! I've got around half an hour before the morning rush hits. You said before you wanted to pitch your products?
请进！我还有大约半小时，之后就早高峰了。你之前说想给我推介一下你的产品？

2.
谢谢，我知道你们的咖啡店早上最忙，我不会耽误你太久的。
Thank you, I know your coffee shop is the busiest in the morning. I won't hold you up for too long.

3.
That's right. Most of our trade happens in the morning. Afternoons are pretty quiet. Folks around here tend to clock in and out early.
是啊，我们大部分的生意都集中在上午，下午就很冷清。这附近的人上下班都挺早的。

4.
我知道你的顾客大多是建筑工人和技工，我觉得他们会喜欢我的产品的。你需要多少，我都能供货。
I know most of your customers are construction workers and tradespeople, and I think they'll love my products. You name the quantity, and I can supply it.

5.
I'm always on the lookout for new offerings. I make my own sandwiches and salads, but I also source from suppliers like you.
我总是对新产品很感兴趣。我自己做三明治和沙拉，但也会从像您这样的供应商那里拿货。

6.
我很乐意每天给你送来新鲜的产品。我会根据你的热销产品，来调整供应的。
I'm happy to deliver fresh products daily. I can adjust my supply based on what sells best.

7.
That's amazing! You never know which product will be the hit. I'd love to hear more about what you offer.
太好了！你永远不知道哪款会成为热销品。我很想多了解一下你的产品。

8.
我擅长烘焙，尤其是蛋糕和饼干。这些食谱都是我祖母传下来的。
I specialize in baking, especially cakes and cookies—my recipes come straight from my grandmother.

9.
I see. You bake old-fashioned treats that spark childhood nostalgia. I think they'll be a hit.
我明白了。你做的是那种能唤起童年记忆的传统点心。我觉得它们肯定很受欢迎。

10.
是的，很多人都很喜欢我的食谱。我已经把业务拓展了，有了更大的店铺，生意还在不断增长。
Yes, lots of people love my recipes. I've expanded my business and got a bigger shop, and business keeps growing.

11.
Well, I think your products would fit my café perfectly. Can you come by with some samples this week?
嗯，我觉得你的产品会非常适合我的咖啡馆。你这周能带些样品过来吗？

12.
当然可以，没问题的。我会带上产品目录和批发价表。周四您方便吗？
Sure thing. No problem. I'll bring my product catalogue and wholesale price list. Is Thursday good for you?

13.
Thursday works great. My business partner will be here too, and we can decide then.
星期四很合适。我的生意合伙人那天也会在，我们那时候可以做决定。

14.
太好了。我很期待见到你的合伙人。谢谢你给我这个机会，周四见！
Great. I look forward to meeting your partner. Thanks for the opportunity—see you on Thursday!
