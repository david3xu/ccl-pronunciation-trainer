# 70060. Lease of Housing - Business

Briefing: The following dialogue takes place over the phone between Jenny, an English-speaking real estate agent and a mandarin speaking client. The dialogue starts now.

1. Hi, this is Jenny from Southbank Real Estate. I'm calling to inform you that your rental application has been approved.  
(您好，我是南岸地产的珍妮。我打电话给您是要通知您，您的租房申请已经批了。)

2. 你好，珍妮。这真是个好消息啊！现在我需要做什么呢？  
(Hello, Jenny！That's such great news! What do I need to do now?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
News 不可数，所以不要说 a good news

3. You need to come over and sign a lease of housing. Apart from that, you need to pay four weeks' rent as bond and two week's rent in advance. What time suits you?  
(您需要过来签一个租房合同。另外，您得交四周的房租作为押金，再预付两周的房租。您什么时间方便呢？)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
Come over: if someone comes over to your place, they visit you there. 拜访  
Lease = rental agreement 租约；租房合同

4. 明天，或者周四都可以的。我需要先去学校接孩子，然后再去您的办公室。如果我们可以下午 4 点以后见面，我的时间就很充裕了。  
(Tomorrow is good for me, or Thursday. I need to pick up my kids from school first, and then I'll head to your office. I'll have enough time if we could meet after 4 pm.)

5. I see. Is 4:30 p.m. tomorrow okay for you?  
(我知道了。明天下午四点半，您可以吗？)

6. 好的。我没办法全部用卡支付。我可以用现金吗？  
(Yes. I'm not able to pay all the money by card. Is it okay if I pay in cash?)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
现金支付，pay in cash, 固定搭配，不要说 pay by cash

7. Yes. I'll write you a receipt so that you can keep it as a record. Your rental bond will be deposited with the Residential Tenancies Bond Authority.  
(可以的。 我会给您开一个收据，您就可以留底了。您的押金会存到住房租赁押金管理局那边的。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
根据 Tenants Australia 官网中文手册，押金将由住宅租赁押金管理局(Residential Tenancies Bond Authority)保管，因此它仍属于房客(Tenants)名下，并不归房东和中介所有。

8. 好的。我会在午饭时间把这些都弄好。我还需要带什么别的文件吗？  
(Okay. I'll get these done during lunch time. Is there anything else that I should bring with me?)

9. No. All you have to do is to pay the bond, the rent and sign the lease of housing. The property is currently vacant, so I can give you the keys tomorrow.  
(不用的。您只需要把押金和房租交了，把租房合同签了。现在房子是空的，所以明天我就可以把钥匙给您。)

10. 太好了！我真想尽快拿到钥匙搬进去啊！我总算能帮我家人在学校旁边找到房子了！我太开心了！  
(That's great! I can't wait to get the keys and move in! I've finally found a place near the school for my family. I'm really happy.)

11. The house really is wonderful and in a great location. I'm sure you'll be happy living in it. I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow to finalize everything.  
(房子确实很棒，地点也很好。您们一定可以住得很开心的。我也盼着明天跟您见面，把一切办妥。)

12. 太谢谢你了珍妮！要不是你的帮忙，事情不会这么顺利的！  
(Thank you so much Jenny! It couldn't have gone this smoothly without your help.)

"要不是你的帮忙，事情不会这么顺利的"需要用虚拟语气。 微信搜索"萤火虫 CCL"公众号，其中的三分钟英翻中课堂，对于 CCL 常考虚拟语气类型, 有结合美剧的更详细讲解和词汇拓展哟

13. No worries. That's what we're here for.  
(不客气。这是我们的工作。)

【萤火虫老师 Tips】  
That's what we're here for = That's our job.
