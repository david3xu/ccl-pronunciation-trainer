#70193. Talking Through a Retirement Plan - Business

1.
Morning! Thanks a lot for calling in. What can I help you with today?
早上好，谢谢你打电话来。我今天能帮你点什么？

2.
你好呀，我想聊聊我的退休计划，可以吗？我最近一直在考虑这个问题。
Hey there! I was hoping to talk about my retirement plan—if that's okay? It's just something that's been on my mind lately.

3.
Of course! That's exactly what I do. I help people with retirement planning. It's super important to have enough saved up so you can live comfortably once you stop working.
当然可以啦，我专门做这个的。我帮大家做退休规划。存够钱很重要，这样退休后才能过得舒舒服服的。

4.
对，我想管理好开支，退休以后能有更多时间去做现在没空做的事。
Yeah, I want to keep my expenses under control and have more time in retirement to do the things I don't really get to do right now.

5.
Yeah, totally. The earlier you plan, the better. Plus, it's better to keep checking in on your plan, because your situation and needs are always changing.
没错，越早开始规划越好。而且，最好时不时检查一下计划，因为你的情况和需求一直会变。

6.
我以前确实没太考虑这些事。不过，现在离退休不远了。我觉得要重新整理一下了。
I hadn't really thought about this before. But as I get closer to retirement age, I think it's time to revisit my plan.

7.
Absolutely. This isn't something you just set up once and forget about. But I'll make it easier for you. So: where do you want to start?
当然了，这不是那种一次搞定就能不管的事。不过我会帮您把过程简化。那您想先从哪块儿说起？

8.
我不知道自己到底该存多少钱。我看新闻和媒体都有讲这方面的事，我挺担心自己的积蓄不够用。
I'm not really sure how much money I need to save. I see news and media talking about this, and I'm pretty worried my savings won't cut it.

9.
That's a common concern that many people share. I hear folks throw out some figures all the time. But honestly, it all depends on your own goals. What you need might be totally different from someone else.
是啊，很多人都会担心这件事。我经常听到有人随口提一些数字。但说实话，这完全取决于你自己的目标——每个人的需求可能完全不同。

10.
说得有道理。我得先搞清楚我想过什么样的退休生活，才能对症下药地规划。
That makes sense. I need to figure out what kind of retirement life I really want so I can plan accordingly.

11.
Exactly. Once you've got a clear picture of what you need, I can help you figure out how to get there step by step.
完全正确。一旦你搞清楚了自己需要什么，我就能一步步帮你规划达成目标的方案。

12.
我挺开心能终于开始动手整理我的退休理财了。毕竟，我已经有一段时间没管这个问题了。
I'm really glad I'm finally doing something about my retirement finances. After all, I've been ignoring it for a while.

13.
That's a solid first step. I can also send you a few forms to help you think through what things you'll need to take into account when planning.
这是很棒的第一步。我还可以发你一些表格，帮你理清在做计划时要考虑的点。

14.
好的。最好能在我下一次预约之前，把表格发过来。我想先看看内容，再决定怎么继续，这样会比较安心。多谢你。
Sounds good. It would be great if you could send those forms over before I book the next session. I'd feel more comfortable looking things over first before I decide how to move forward. Thanks a lot.
