#70181. From Clinic to Home - Medical

1.
Good afternoon, it's good to see you again. How can I help you today?
下午好，很高兴再次见到您。今天有什么可以帮您的？

2.
下午好，我很好，谢谢。我想为我父亲来预约个时间。
Good afternoon, I'm doing well, thank you. I'd like to schedule an appointment for my father.

3.
Of course. Please take a seat and make yourself comfortable. The doctor will be with you shortly. He is on time for appointments today.
当然，请坐，放轻松。医生很快就会过来，今天他出诊非常准时。

4.
太好了。在我们等待的时候，如果你有几分钟空闲时间，我能请教你一些问题吗？
That's great. While we wait, if you have a few minutes free, may I ask you some questions?

5.
Sure, no problem. It's quiet at the moment, so I'm free. I just need to pick up the phone if it rings.
当然，没问题。现在这里很安静，所以我有时间。只不过要是电话响了，我得去接。

6.
我父亲上个月割伤了腿，感染了，伤口需要换药。这就是我们定期来诊所的原因。
My father cut his leg last month, and it got infected; his wound needs regular dressing changes. That's why we come to the clinic regularly.

7.
I understand. Proper wound dressing is very important to control infection and help the cut heal properly, although it's often uncomfortable.
我明白。妥善换药对于控制感染和促使伤口正确愈合非常重要，虽然这通常不太舒服。

8.
不是的，他觉得非常疼。每次来诊所对他来说都很折腾。我想知道有没有居家护理护士可以帮忙。
No, he finds it very painful. Every visit to the clinic is exhausting for him. I wonder if there's a home care nurse available to help.

9.
A home care nurse can handle a range of medical needs. It might be a much easier option in your father's situation.
居家护理护士可以处理各种医疗需求。对于您父亲的情况来说，这个选择可能轻松得多。

10.
我也觉得。我们两个都觉得现在的情况很麻烦，但是我们不清楚怎么安排，也不清楚跟谁联系。
I think so too. We both find the current situation very troublesome, but we're not sure how to arrange it or whom to contact.

11.
You can ask the doctor about it. He can refer you to a service provider and give you information about the process.
您可以问问医生。他可以转介您到相关服务机构，并提供办理流程的信息。

12.
哦，太好了。我等会儿就问医生。我本以为这或许比转诊更复杂。感谢您的信息！
Oh, that's great. I'll ask the doctor shortly. I originally thought this might be more complicated than a referral. Thanks for the information!

13.
I'm happy to help. I think you will find that this arrangement works very well. But I will miss seeing you and your father at the clinic.
我很乐意帮忙。我相信您会发现这个安排非常合适。但我会想念在诊所见到您和您父亲的日子。

14.
我们还会定期来做检查，我们信任这里的医生。您和其他工作人员都非常友善，谢谢！
We will still come in for regular check-ups because we trust the doctors here. You and the other staff are all very kind—thank you!
