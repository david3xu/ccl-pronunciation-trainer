#70027. TAFE Course Consultation - Education

1.
Hello, this is Jimmy from Glen Technical and Further Education. How can I help you?
你好。我是格伦技术和继续教育学院的吉米。我能如何帮到你呢？

2.
你好，我想成为一名物理治疗师，想咨询一下这个文凭入学的要求。
Hi, I want to become a physiotherapist and I'd like to ask about the admission requirements for this diploma.

3.
Well, first you need to successfully complete senior high school level studies and pass a literacy and numeracy exam.
首先你需要完成高中教育，然后你需要通过一个读写和算术考试。

4.
哦，我上完高中了，不过是在中国上的。可以吗？
I see. I have finished senior high school, but it was in China. Is that okay?

5.
That's okay. For those who complete high school studies in non-English speaking countries, they need to sit for an authorized English test and achieve at least 80% in Writing, Reading and Speaking.
可以的。对于在非英语国家完成高中学习的申请人来说，他们需要参加一个通过认可的英语语言测试，并且在写作，阅读和口语几项中分数至少要达到80%。

6.
我之前从来没有参加过英语考试，我都是在家自学的。我可以在你们这里学习英语考试课程吗？
I've never taken any English tests before. I usually teach myself at home. May I take any courses here to pass that English test?

7.
You can take this brochure with a list of authorized English tests inside. We also have courses available to help improve your English.
你可以拿一本这个小册子，上面列出了我们认可的英语语言测试。我们也有课程可以帮你提高英语。

8.
好的，那请问，如果我通过了英语考试，并且被学校录取了，学费是多少呢？
Okay. Then may I please know how much the tuition is if I pass the English test and be admitted?

9.
Tuition fees don't apply for this course. However, you can apply for a student loan to pay all or part of your tuition fees from the Department of Education and Training if you were an Australian citizen or a permanent resident and meet the residence requirements.
学费不适用于这个课程。不过，如果你是澳大利亚公民或者永久居民，并且满足居住要求，你可以向教育和培训部申请学生贷款，来支付你所有或者部分的学费。

10.
好的，如果政府帮我交了学费，以后我还要还钱吗？我现在没有工作，也没有任何积蓄。
Okay. Do I need to pay it back in the future if the government helps me with the tuition fee? I don't have a job or any savings at the moment.

11.
You need to pay the tuition reimbursement back after you find a paid job. To get this loan, you'll need a tax file number and a request form, which must be filled in and submitted to your education provider before the census date.
在你找到带薪工作以后，你需要把政府给你报销的学费还回去。如果要申请这笔贷款，你需要提供你的税号，申请表，并且要在学校截止日之前，填好并交给你申请的学校。

12.
谢谢您提供的信息。原来还有这么多需要准备的东西啊！不过这样可以激励我。我会在截止时间之前提交所需要的文件的。
Thank you for the information provided. It turns out that I have a massive list of things to prepare. It can motivate me though. I'll submit all the documents required before the deadline.
