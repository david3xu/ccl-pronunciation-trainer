1.
Hi. Nice to see you. You must be excited to start your new business.
嗨，很高兴见到你。你一定很激动要开始你的新生意吧。

2.
嗯，我打算开一个新生意。我已经有了一些初步的想法，但是还有一些细节需要想想。
Well, I'm planning to start a new business. I already have some initial ideas, but there are still some details to think about.

3.
Of course. I think there are still a lot of things to consider before going ahead. Tell me about your business ideas.
当然，我觉得在继续之前还有很多事情要考虑。告诉我你的商业想法吧。

4.
我打算开一个肥皂生意。我做肥皂好多年了，它们作为礼物很受欢迎。我现在打算出售肥皂。
I plan to start a soap business. I've been making soaps for many years—they're popular as gifts. Now I intend to sell soaps.

5.
All right. You have your product; you also have experience making them. You just need to organize the business aspects properly.
好的，你已经有产品了，也有制作经验。你只需把商业方面的事安排好就行了。

6.
没错，这就是我为什么来这儿。我想得到专业的帮助，找到最好的方法来卖肥皂。
Exactly. That's why I came here. I want professional help to find the best way to sell soap.

7.
I'm happy to help. Tell me more about your soap. What's special about it compared with other products on the market?
我很乐意帮助。跟我说说你的肥皂吧。它跟市面上的其他产品相比有什么特别之处？

8.
嗯，这是一种不同的肥皂。它是专门针对狗狗的。市场上有很多狗狗香波，但肥皂不多。
Well, this is a different soap. It's specially made for dogs. There are many dog shampoos on the market, but not many soaps.

9.
That's a surprise. I didn't expect dogs would be your top market. Do you know why dog owners would choose your products?
真让我惊讶。我没想到狗狗会是你的主要市场。你知道为什么狗主人会选你的产品吗？

10.
这个肥皂是用天然材质制作的，没有化学物质、没有添加剂。里面还加入了精油成分，让狗狗闻起来更清新。
This soap is made with natural materials, with no chemicals or additives. It also contains essential oils to make dogs smell fresher.

11.
OK. I will create a marketing plan and add a few points based on what we discussed before. I just need to do some research first.
好的。我会制定一个营销计划，并根据我们之前讨论的内容补充几点。我只不过需要先做些调研。

12.
太好了。我接下来一两周需要这个计划。我已经有了售卖计划，希望你有足够的时间。
Great. I'll need this plan in the next week or two. I already have a selling plan—hope you'll have enough time.

13.
Yes, that timeline works for me. You'll also need a website. If you don't have one yet, I can include some options in the plan.
好的，这个时间表对我来说没问题。你还需要一个网站。如果还没有，我可以在方案里加一些选项。

14.
一定要，请你一定要加上。这会很有帮助。我还有很多事要做。
Definitely. Please make sure to include it. That'd be really helpful. I still have a lot to do.
