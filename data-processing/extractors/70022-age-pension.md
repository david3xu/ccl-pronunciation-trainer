#70022. Age Pension - Social Welfare

1.
Come in and take a seat please. I'm Ben from Centrelink. It's good to see you in person. What can I do for you today?
请进来坐吧。我是社会福利联络中心的本。很高兴见到您本人。今天能为您做些什么呢？

2.
您好。朋友跟我说，我可以申请明年八月的养老金，因为那时候我就66岁了，作为水管工退休。
Hello. My friend told me that I can claim to get age pension in August next year, because I'll be 66 years old then and will retire as a plumber.

3.
There are some eligibility criteria that you need to meet, such as your age and residency. I mean, this pension is for Australian permanent residents and citizens only.
有一些资格条件是您需要满足的，比如您的年龄和居民身份。我的意思是，这个养老金是仅为澳大利亚永久居民和公民设置的。

4.
我已经成为澳大利亚公民20年了。当时我拿的配偶签证来的澳大利亚。
I have been an Australian citizen for 20 years. I came to Australia on a partner visa at that time.

5.
That's great. The reason I asked is that to get the Age Pension you need to meet a 10-year-residency requirement. Moreover, for at least 5 of these years, there must be no break in your residence.
那很好。我这样问的原因是，你需要满足十年居民身份要求，才能拿到养老金。除此之外，其中至少五年，你需要连续居住在澳大利亚。

6.
好的。对了，我还想起来一点，我退休以后就没有工作了，也没有收入了。我老伴也是最近十年都没有工作。
Okay. It just occurred to me that I won't have work or income after my retirement. My spouse also hasn't worked for the recent 10 years.

7.
Thanks for the information. You need to go through an income and assets test to determine your payment. The income will consist of all sources of funds. Do you have any property, assets or overseas income? What about investment property, superannuation or shares?
感谢您提供的信息。你需要通过一个收入资产评估来确定您能拿到的金额。你的收入会包括所有的资金来源。您有任何房产，资产或者海外收入吗？或者有什么投资房，退休金或者股票吗？

8.
哦，说到资产，我的理财师告诉我，我们有一栋共同房产，价值60万澳币。我们还有股票和其他投资，价值大概在五万四千元左右。这些资产都是在我和我老伴联名的。
Speaking of assets, according to my financial planner, we have a property which is worth 600,000 Australian dollars. We also have shares and other investments, which are worth around 54,000 Australian dollars. We are the joint owners of these assets.

9.
Well, we will look at the type and value of any assets you own in and outside of Australia. The value of your assets is what you'd get if you sold them at market value. Your income seems to be over a certain threshold of 36,000 and you may only get part of the pension.
这样啊。你们在澳大利亚境内和境外拥有的任何财产及其价值我们都会看的。你的财产的价值是指你出售它们的市场价值。你的收入似乎超过了一个36,000澳币的门槛，这样你可能只能拿到一部分的养老金了。

10.
那我只能拿到一部分养老金了啊？好吧，我还听说我能拿到两种不同的福利补贴。您能具体给我说一说吗？
Then I can only get a part of age pension, right? I heard that I could get two different kinds of benefits. Could you explain it to me in detail?

11.
Sure. You can get a Pensioner Concession Card for cheaper prescription and other health services. You can also get a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card so that you could receive life services provided by the state government and your local council.
你可以拿到一张福利金领取者优惠卡，这样可以以更低的价格购买处方药和享受其他医疗服务。你也可以拿到一张联邦老年健康卡，这样你就可以享受州政府和当地市政厅提供的生活服务了。

12.
那我就放心一些了。至少我还是能从政府领到一部分福利的。谢谢您的帮助。
Then I'm relieved to some extent. At least I can get part of government benefits. Thank you for your help.
