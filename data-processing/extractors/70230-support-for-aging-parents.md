#70230. Support for Aging Parents - Business

1.
Good morning! I haven't run into you much lately. I heard you've been on the go from morning till night. How have you been doing?
早上好！最近都不怎么碰到你，听说你最近从早到晚都很忙。你最近还好吗？

2.
谢谢你的关心！最近我常常去看我妈妈，她腿疼，身体还不太舒服。所以，我总要抽时间过去。
Thanks for asking! Recently, I've been visiting my mother a lot. She's been having leg pain and isn't feeling well, so I've been making time to see her.

3.
I remember you said your mother has joint issues. The round trip must take hours. I can imagine how tough this is for you.
我记得你说过你妈妈有关节问题。来回一趟得好几个小时吧？我能想象这对你来说得有多辛苦。

4.
是呀，我母亲不喜欢热闹，所以住在郊外。来回要开车2个小时。我基本就没什么空余时间了。
Yeah, my mom prefers quiet places, so she lives in the suburbs. It's a two-hour drive each way. I barely have any free time left.

5.
Maybe you could speak with a social worker. They might be able to check on your mother sometimes. They've helped people in similar situations.
或许你可以跟社工聊聊，说不定他们可以偶尔去看看你妈妈。他们以前也帮过跟你情况类似的人。

6.
那太好了，我之前还不知道有这种服务可以用呢。那我该联系谁呢？我得赶紧弄清楚。
That would be great. I didn't even know that kind of service was available. Who should I talk to? I'd better look into it immediately.

7.
My friend got some government payments last year. You could try contacting the same office. Also, there are social worker directories available.
我有个朋友去年也领过政府的一些补助。你可以试着找同一个部门问问。另外，还有社工名录。

8.
我自己没领过什么政府福利，我会试试的。社工名录听上去也很有帮助。
I've never received any government benefits myself. I'd like to give it a try. The social worker directory sounds really helpful too.

9.
It's important to find someone with qualifications. Even if they can't help you directly, they'll know who can.
找到有资质的人很重要。就算他们不能直接帮你，他们也一定知道谁可以帮你。

10.
这些信息对我太有用了。我其实还有不少父母养老的问题，希望他们愿意帮忙。
This info is super helpful. I've actually got a lot of questions about caring for aging parents. I hope they'll be willing to help.

11.
You're such a devoted child. It's always difficult when parents get older. They do need more care.
你很孝顺。父母年纪大了，总是件难事。他们需要的照顾更多。

12.
我想请社工帮妈妈做家庭安全评估，比如安装扶手和防滑垫。这样她在家里会更安全。
I'd like to ask a social worker to help my mother with a home safety assessment, like installing handrails and non-slip mats. That way she'll be safer in her place.

13.
Lots of community centers host a weekly free lunch for seniors. Your mother might enjoy the company.
许多社区中心每周都会为老年人提供免费午餐。你妈妈可能会喜欢有人一起陪伴。

14.
这真是个好主意！我妈妈很喜欢有人陪她一起吃饭。我马上联系他们。非常感谢你的帮助！
That's a great idea! My mother enjoys having someone eat with her. I'll get in touch with them right away. Thank you very much for your help!
