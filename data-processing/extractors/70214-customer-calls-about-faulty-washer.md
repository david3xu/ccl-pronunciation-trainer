#70214. Customer Calls About Faulty Washer - Business

1.
Hi there, this is the appliance shop speaking. My name is Adrian. How can I assist you today?
你好，这里是电器商店。我是艾德利安。今天我能为您做点什么？

2.
你好！我前段时间在你们这里买了一台洗衣机，但最近坏掉了，总是发出尖锐的噪音，吓得我已经一周没用它了。
Hey there! I bought a washing machine from you guys a while back, but it's been faulty lately. It always makes a piercing noise, and I've been too scared to use it for a week.

3.
Oh no, sorry to hear that. Do you remember exactly when you bought it? If it's still under warranty, we might be able to fix it at no cost.
哎呀，听到这些我很抱歉。你还记得具体什么时候买吗？如果还在保修期内，我们可能可以免费维修。

4.
我是五个月前买的，之前一直运转得挺不错的，我原本还挺满意的。结果现在噪音又刺耳，又漏水。
I bought it five months ago, and it was working great. I was actually pretty happy with it. But now it's getting so noisy and it's even leaking water.

5.
That should still be covered. Would you prefer getting it repaired, or would you rather we replace it for you?
这应该还在保修范围内。你希望我们修理它，还是换一台新的给你？

6.
是说我不用出钱修吗？我有点搞不清保修是什么意思。维修费用是不是都很高啊？
Does that mean I don't have to pay? I'm not too sure what warranty really means. Is repair usually expensive?

7.
Exactly. Warranty means we'll cover the repair or even replace it for free, as long as the issue wasn't caused by misuse.
没错。保修就是在一定时间内，只要不是人为损坏，维修或更换都是免费的。

8.
太好了。我之前还担心得自己掏钱修。那我就放心了。我还是想把原机修好。
Great. I was worried I'd have to pay out of pocket. Then I'm relieved. I'd prefer to get the original machine fixed.

9.
Got it. I'll make sure a technician gets out to you soon. Can you tell me when someone can come by?
明白了。我会安排技术员尽快过去。您什么时候方便让人上门看看？

10.
这个嘛，我做零售促销兼职，周一和周五不上班，这两天安排都可以。
Sure, I work part-time in retail promotions, and I'm off on Mondays and Fridays. Either of those days works for me.

11.
That works. One of our technicians will reach out to set up an appointment. The technician may need to run a diagnostic cycle to identify the fault.
好的。我们的技师会联系你预约具体时间。技师可能需要运行诊断程序来找出故障。

12.
这一套操作下来大概要多久？希望能快点修好。我在家等着的时候，要准备些什么吗？比如螺丝刀？
How long does the whole process usually take? I really hope the washer gets fixed soon. When I'm waiting at home, should I have anything ready—like a screwdriver?

13.
The basic check usually takes about half an hour, and if we need to open it up for a motor inspection, it will be around sixty minutes. You don't have to get any tools ready.
整套流程大概半小时，如果需要拆机检查电机，会大概60分钟。你不需要准备任何工具。

14.
好。那我在家等他们过来检查吧，希望不要是电机的问题。谢谢你的耐心服务。
Alright, I'll wait at home for them to come check it. Hopefully, it's not a problem with the motor. Thanks for your patience.
