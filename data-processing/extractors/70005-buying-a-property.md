#70005. Buying a Property - Housing

1.
Good morning, Ms. Wu! I'm David from Property Solutions. I know that you came here today because you want to purchase a property, is that correct?
早上好，吴女士！我是来自房地产咨询公司的大卫。我知道你今天来是因为您想要购置房产，对吗？

2.
您好，谢谢你抽时间见我。是的，我想要买房，最好是已经建成的房子，因为我想要尽快搬进去。
Hi. Thank you for making time to see me. Yes, I'd like to buy a property and it would be better if it's an already built one, because I want to move in as soon as possible.

3.
Well, you have come to the right place. We offer properties in different price ranges. What is your maximum budget and what kind of house are you looking for?
嗯，您来对地方啦。我们有各种不同价位的房产。您的预算最多是多少呢？您想要什么样的房子呢？

4.
我的预算在120万左右。我希望房子附近三公里有中小学校。房子有三到四个房间，其中一个最好是套房，有嵌入式衣柜。房子里最好还要有游泳池。我有一个三角钢琴，所以希望客厅嘛大一点，能放得下它。
My budget is around 1.2 million. I hope there are secondary and primary schools within three kilometers. I'd like a house with three to four bedrooms and hopefully, one of them is a suite with a built-in wardrobe. It would be better if the house comes with a swimming pool. I have a grand piano, so I hope the living room is large enough for it.

5.
Well, this one here does not only meet your requirements, but also is within walking distance to train stations and schools. This house is also built with solar panels which help reduce your electricity bill.
那么，这栋房子不仅满足了您的要求，而且走路就能到火车站和学校。这栋房子还建有太阳能板，还能帮您省电。

6.
这房子听上去不错。我是自己住，不是投资，那我是不是不用交资本增值税啦？
This one sounds good. It will be owner occupied/it's for residential use instead of investment purpose. Does it mean that I don't have to pay capital gains tax?

7.
If this is your principal home, you do not have to pay capital gains tax when selling the property in the future. By the way, is this the first time you're purchasing a property? If yes, you may be eligible to receive a grant from the government as a first home buyer.
如果这套房是您的主要住房，您在未来卖房的时候是不需要交资本增值税的。顺便问一句，这是您第一次买房吗？如果是第一次买，您也许有资格作为首次购房者从政府那儿收到补助。

8.
那太好了，我是第一次购房。如果我想要拿到首次购房的津贴，需要符合什么资格呢？
That's great. It is my first time. What are the eligibility criteria/requirements for this first home owner grant?

9.
To be eligible for the grant, the house you purchase has to be a new home, meaning that it cannot be previously occupied or sold as a place of residence.
如果要满足津贴的资格，你购买的房子必须是新房，也就是说该房产之前不能有人住过，也不能作为居住房被出售过。

10.
原来是这样。那我买了房子之后，能马上搬进去吗？
I see. Can I move in immediately after the purchase?

11.
Since this is your principal place of residence, you may need to move in within 12 months after the settlement by law, but I don't think this will be a problem for you.
鉴于这是您的自住房，您需要在法定交割日期到达之后的12个月之内入住, 不过我觉得这对您来说应该不是问题。

12.
听起来不错，我想我会马上住进去的。那我们现在可以去看看房子吗？
It sounds good. I think I'll move in immediately. Then could we inspect the house now?

13.
No problem. I'll show you around. Let's go.
没问题。我带您去看一下。我们走吧。
