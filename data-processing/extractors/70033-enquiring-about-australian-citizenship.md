#70033. Enquiring About Australian Citizenship - Immigration

1.
Good afternoon. This is Chris from the Department of Home Affairs. How can I help you today?
下午好。我是内政事务部的克里斯。我今天能怎么帮到您呢？

2.
下午好。我想了解一下我是否有资格申请澳大利亚公民。我听说需要交300澳币左右的申请费呢。
Good afternoon. I'd like to know if I'm eligible to apply for Australian citizenship. I heard that I need to pay an application fee of around 300 Australian dollars.

3.
Well, the standard Australian citizenship for General eligibility costs $285 for the test and certificate. If you apply via partner visa, it would cost around $10,000 or more.
符合一般资格要求的澳洲公民的标准申请，费用是285澳币，其中包含了公民考试和证书。如果你通过伴侣签证申请，费用大约是一万澳币或者更多。

4.
我四年前和我老公持临时签证来的澳大利亚。我老公后来拿到了雇主担保签证。六个月前我们拿到了澳洲绿卡。
I came to Australia with my husband on temporary visas four years ago. Then he got an employer nomination scheme visa. We became permanent residents six months ago.

5.
To be eligible for Australian citizenship, you must have been an Australian permanent resident for at least 1 year and been a lawfully resident in Australia for at least 4 years before you apply.
如果要符合澳大利亚公民申请资格，你必须已经至少成为澳大利亚永久居民一年，并且在申请之前，已经在澳大利亚合法居住至少四年。

6.
好吧，那我再等六个月。我听说还需要参加一个考试，这个考试是考什么呢？
Okay. I'll wait for another six months. I heard that there's also a test. What's on the test?

7.
Yes. There's a knowledge test about Australia. To pass the test, you need to have equitable knowledge about Australia, as well as the rights and privilege of being a citizen.
是的。这是一个考察对澳大利亚知识了解程度的考试。如果要通过考试，你需要对澳大利亚有公正合理的了解，并且了解作为公民需要有的权利和特权。

8.
听起来很复杂啊。我能怎么准备这个考试呢？有没有什么备考材料呢？
It sounds complicated. What can I do to prepare for this test? Are there any materials for it?

9.
We do have online resources that would help you prepare for this test. We also have four practice tests.
我们确实有网络资源可以帮你备考。我们还有四套练习题。

10.
哎。这些练习题是不是都是英语的啊？英语不好真吃亏。我老公英语就很好。他还有几年的专业工作经验呢。
Are these practice tests in English? It's a huge disadvantage when my English is not good. My husband's English is good. He also has several years of professional work experience.

11.
Unfortunately, one of the aims of this test is to assess the candidate's basic knowledge of English language.
很遗憾，这个考试的目的之一就是测试应试者的基本英语知识。

12.
那我肯定过不了。我的英语太差了。不过还是谢谢你的帮助。
Then I bet I won't pass it. My English is so poor. Thank you for your help anyway.
