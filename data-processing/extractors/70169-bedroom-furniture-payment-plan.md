#70169. Bedroom Furniture Payment Plan - Business

1.
Good afternoon, I'm Ian. Let me know if I can help you with anything in the store.
下午好，我是伊恩。您在店里需要任何帮助，随时跟我说。

2.
你好，伊恩，请帮帮我，我想买一个双人床，一个衣柜，还有两个床头柜。
Hello, Ian, I need your help. I want to buy a double bed, a wardrobe, and two bedside tables.

3.
Yes, we have a lot of different bedroom furniture. I'm sure you'll find the size that suits you.
好的，我们有很多不同的卧室家具。我相信您会找到适合您尺寸的。

4.
我很喜欢这个深色木质家具，但它要2000澳元，而我银行账户上没有那么多钱。
I really like this dark wood furniture, but it costs $2000, and I don't have that much in my bank account.

5.
You can pay by credit card. We also have a payment plan. To qualify, you need to earn more than 5,000 dollars a year and work full-time.
您可以使用信用卡付款。我们也有分期付款方案。要符合条件，您的年收入需超过5000澳元，且需全职工作。

6.
我没有信用卡，但是我确实是全职工作。我想更多地了解一下付款计划的信息。
I don't have a credit card, but I am working full-time. I'd like to learn more about the payment plan.

7.
You need to pay 84 dollars each month. You have two years to pay back the 2,000 dollars.
您每月需要支付84澳元，您有两年的时间来偿还这2000澳元。

8.
这个付款方式有额外的费用或者利息吗？如果我用这个付款计划的话，会不会付得更多？
Are there any extra fees or interest with this payment method? Would I end up paying more if I use this payment plan?

9.
You need to pay a 90-dollar application fee for this plan. There won't be any additional charges if you repay the loan within two years.
您需要支付90澳元的申请费用。如果您在两年内还清贷款，则不会有额外的费用。

10.
那我应该可以在两年之内还完。不过，如果我确实需要额外的时间来还款的话，会怎么样呢？
Then I should be able to repay it within two years. But what if I do need extra time to pay it off?

11.
After two years, we will charge you 10 percent interest if you need more time to repay. If you'd like to apply for the plan, I can help you now.
两年之后，如果您需要更多时间来还款，我们将收取10%的利息。如果您想申请这个方案，我现在可以帮您。

12.
没问题，我想现在申请。我觉得这个付款计划很适合我，我真的很期待能买这套卧室家具。
No problem, I'd like to apply now. I think this payment plan is perfect for me, and I'm really looking forward to getting this bedroom furniture set.
