about the details 
leash my dog 
comes to detilas 
on the beach 
I'm completely lost 
needs to be leashed 
in public spaces 
two designated off-leash parks 
they can roam 
the southern section 
of the beach 
is also leash-free
loves splashing around
in the water 
rolling in the sand 
and chasing seagulls 
any spots where dogs aren't allowed
in certain spots 
like kids' playgrounds
sports ovals 
and some beaches 
look out for the signs 
before you go in 
accidenally 
don't follow the rules 
what penalties might I face 
what's the worst that could happen 
break the rules 
letting your dog off-leash 
where it's banned 
get fined 
how serious the breach is 
jumps on everyone it meets
pay extra attention 
i need to look out for 
pick up after your dog 
leaving dog waste 
means a fine as well
we've placed bins in most parks 
clean up after my dog

I didn't catch 
it's driven by

cluttered with 
furniture and stuff 
move into one like that 
focus on the floor plan 
getting distracted by 
the furnishings
