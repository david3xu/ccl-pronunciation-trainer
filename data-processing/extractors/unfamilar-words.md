the city council 
dog-walking regulations
I heard some neighbours 
get really startled 
when they see dogs 
know the rules first

means following rules

have you had a chance 
to check any local regulations
not really sure about the details 
leash my dog 
comes to details 
are allowed on the beach 
I'm completely lost 
needs to be leashed 
in public spaces 
two designated off-leash parks 
they can roam 
the southern section of the beach 
is also leash-free
loves splashing around in the water 
rolling in the sand 
and chasing seagulls 
any spots where dogs aren't allowed
in certain spots 
like kids' playgrounds
sports ovals 
and some beaches 
just look out for the signs 
before you go in 
accidentally don't follow the rules 
what penalties might I face 
what's the worst that could happen 
break the rules 
like letting your dog off-leash 
where it's banned 
get fined 
fines vary based on 
how serious the breach is 
always jumps on everyone it meets
pay extra attention 
i need to look out for 
remeber to pick up after your dog 
leaving dog waste 
means a fine as well
we've placed bins in most parks 
clean up after my dog

to report a driver 
in our apartment complex
who keeps speeding 
the car's engine 
really powerfull and super load 
neawr kid's play areas 
or sidewalks
speeding happen 
take my kid to school
speeding past in his car 
the most recent time 
right at the entrance 
that does sound risky 
do you happen to know 
the car's make and model 
or any other identifying info
a silver car 
I didn't catch 
the license plate number 
I didn't catch 
it's driven by 
a young person 
this cocky look 
on his face 
have you heard 
has noticed this 
has been involved in 
any other incidents
plenty of our neighbours 
scared stiff of him 
he drives insanely fast 
the kids' safety 
dispatch a patrol car

the consequences

long time no see 
I had no clude 
you are house hunting 
renting for years
it's time to 
have a place of my own 
I totally get it 
this area's super convenient 
with mall and part nearby 
re-learn everything all over again 
staying put would be ideal 
switch schools 
and adjust to everything all over again 
the market is flooded with listings 
take a bit to find the right one 
any luck so far 
seen quite a few properties 
there's one we really like 
it's over our budget 
stretch our finances 
that's a shame 
it's smart to 
stick to your budget 
find something you love 
plenty of fish in the sea 
an empty property 
that keeps things simple 
cluttered with furniture and stuff 
move into one like that 
focus on the floor plan 
getting distracted by 
the furnishings 
the decorations
some layouts just won't work for us 
a two-story home 
we prefer a single-level place 
be worth 
checking out 
some of the older homes 
in the area 
match what you're looking for 
don't want major renovations
tweak the layout 
one property could be perfect 
not officially listed 
I know the owner personally 
can set up an inspection 
help arrange it for us 
really hope this works out 
meet our family's needs

being swapped 
got all the time to chat about this 
how to raise some money 
for our school band 
to go on music tours 
put together a fundraiser 
pick the right kind of event 
people would jump at attending 
put together a coupon book with deals 
from the local business 
sell some products from the local shop 
to raise money 
these are all great ideas
how about putting on a conert for the school band 
use the school's venue and equipment 
keep the costs down 
that's a solid idea 
a great way 
to show off the kids' talents 
happy to chip in and support 
get the word out 
people will definitely come 
hosting the event at school 
would save us a lot on venue costs 
invite a few local bands 
to come and perform 
make the concert more professional 
the band members' friends 
and way more exciting 
gonna show up to support 
seeing these local bands 
motivate the kids 
to rehearse harder 
promote the concert 
on their social media 
free promotion 
to make some cakes 
desserts 
to sell for fundraising 
genius 
the vibe will be way more enjoyable 
make the whole thing more fun 
finalize the details 
reach out to some local business 
for sponsorship 
the day after tomorrow 
apply early ofr permission 
to use the school venue 
how to divide things up 
put together a to-do list 
over the next few days

a proper chat 
found any good spots around here 
figured out the supermarket and the school 
the waste sorting system 
here is quite different 
the Aussie bin system 
confuses everyone at first 
what's puzzling you 
three different color bins 
what waste needs separate handling 
the red lid 
general waste 
recycling 
organics 
some items like batteries 
need special drop-off
dispose of old electronic devices 
holds an e-waste collection day 
most supermarkets take them 
where should i dispose 
of old electronic devices 
the city council holds 
an e-waste collection day 
at the community centre 
grow some vegetables 
a few raised garden beds 
a watering hose 
gardening tools  
where to buy them 
the gardening center 
along the high way 
is your best bet 
a wider range of stuff 
I didn't bring any gardening tools 
the shipping costs 
I've got to buy everything again 
picking out new tools 
be pretty fun 
plus, that place isn't too pricey 
which is a bonus 
pick plants 
that grow well in our soil 
that'd be wonderful
choosing the wrong plants 
sit up front and guide me
