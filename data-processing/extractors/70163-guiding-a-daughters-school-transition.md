#70163. Guiding a Daughter's School Transition - Social+Education

1.
Hello, please come in and take a seat! I'm glad to see you. I've been wanting to ask you: how is your daughter doing at her new school?
你好，请进, 请坐！很开心见到你。我一直想问你呢：你女儿在新学校过得怎么样?

2.
我非常高兴您打电话问我。我一直想约时间跟您见一面，聊一聊。
I'm really glad you called to ask me. I've been wanting to set up a time to meet with you and chat.

3.
You mentioned before that changing schools was a good thing for your daughter, but it seems she's encountering some issues now.
你之前跟我说, 你感觉换学校对你女儿来说很好，但好像现在她遇到了一些问题。

4.
是的，转学以后，她的成绩有提高。但是，她在社交方面好像有些困难。她到现在还没有交到任何新朋友呢。
Yes, her grades have improved since the transfer. However, she seems to be having some difficulties socially. She still hasn't made any new friends.

5.
It's great that her grades have improved; that's a very positive sign. Just give her some time to adjust to the school, and gradually she will start making friends.
她的成绩有提高是很棒的。这是个很积极的信号。就多给她点时间去适应学校吧，然后渐渐地，她就会开始交朋友了。

6.
或许吧。我有点担心她。她没有跟我说过什么，但是我知道，她感觉非常孤独。我也不希望她的成绩下降。
Maybe. I'm a bit worried about her. She hasn't said anything to me, but I know she feels very lonely. I don't want her grades to drop either.

7.
Perhaps you could help her find some after school activities that suit her. That way, she might meet some students in similar situations. What does she enjoy doing?
也许你可以给她看看有没有适合她的课外活动。这样她或许可以遇见和她有相似处境的学生。她喜欢做什么呢?

8.
她在她以前的学校参加了乐队的。她离开的时候，她还在乐队里学习。她似乎很享受乐队活动。
She was in the band at her previous school. When she left, she was still learning in the band. She seemed to really enjoy the band activities.

9.
I think the school band is a great idea. It can give her a chance to make friends in a small group setting.
我认为学校乐队是很好的想法。这可以给她一个在小团体里结交朋友的机会。

10.
您真的说到点子上了。她以前是学吹长笛的。我可以和乐队老师确认一下，看一看还能不能让她继续学。
You've really hit the mark. She used to play the flute. I can check with the band teacher to see if she can continue learning.

11.
She could even learn a new instrument. She might also be interested in learning something new. It depends on the band's display arrangements such as the setlist and stage setup.
她甚至可以学个新乐器。她应该也会对学习新东西感兴趣。这要看乐队的演出安排，比如曲目清单和舞台布置。

12.
她马上就放学回家了。我会和她聊一聊。看她想不想尝试一下进乐队。
She will be home from school soon. I'll talk to her and see if she wants to try joining the band.

13.
Alright. You can encourage her to give it a try. Encourage her to put in some extra effort. I think that would be very helpful.
好的。你可以鼓励她试试看。鼓励她多努力一点。我觉得这会很有帮助。

14.
我同意您说的。我很难知道还能再为她做些什么了。但和您聊过以后，真的帮到我很多。谢谢您。
I agree with what you said. I find it hard to know what else I can do for her. But talking with you has really helped me a lot. Thank you.
