#70221. Friendly Support for the New Town Doctor - Social

1.
Hello, nice to see you. I hope you're already settling in. It must be a big change for you to live in this small town. If you need anything, just let me know.
嗨，很高兴见到你。希望你已经安顿下来了。住在这么小的镇上，对你来说，肯定是个很大的改变。如果你需要什么，随时告诉我。

2.
是啊，我从来没在这么小的镇子上住过呢。而且，这里离市区也真的有点远。到最近的几个店，都要开车大概半小时。
Yeah, I've never lived in a town this small before. And it's really a bit far from the city. Driving to the nearest shops takes around 30 minutes.

3.
Yes, it takes a while for you to get used to it. I hope the sense of community can make it up. After all, everyone knows each other here.
是的，要适应得一段时间呢。我希望这里的社区氛围能弥补这点。毕竟，这里大家互相都认识。

4.
这个小镇上的人都很可爱。我适应得还不错。我的小诊所已经开了半年多，通过工作，我也认识了镇上大半的人。
The people in this small town are all really lovely. I'm adjusting well. My little clinic has been open for over six months, and through work I've met nearly half the town.

5.
I'm sure everyone is excited about the new doctor. The previous doctor moved back to the city. It took a while for the replacement doctor to arrive.
我肯定大家都对新医生感到很兴奋。之前的医生搬回城里了。过了好一阵子，才有替代的医生来。

6.
现在，我并不打算搬回去。但是，我确实很想念城市里的各种活动、很多东西，还有许多商店。
I don't plan to move back right now, but I do really miss all the events, things, and shops in the city.

7.
I understand. I can order goods for you, if it is something you use regularly, and my shop doesn't have it in stock.
我明白。如果有什么你经常用，我店里没货的东西，我可以帮你订。

8.
太好了，我们刚搬来时，买了几包咖啡豆。但是，快半年了，咖啡快喝完了。
Great, we bought a few bags of coffee beans when we just moved here, but after nearly half a year, we've almost run out of them.

9.
I heard from the receptionist that you have a really nice coffee machine at the doctor's clinic. You must be really missing your favourite brand.
我从前台那里听说，你在诊所里有台很棒的咖啡机。你肯定很想念你最喜欢的咖啡牌子吧。

10.
是的，一不喝咖啡，我一天的工作都没法干。我感觉我的每日咖啡摄入量已经超过健康标准了。
Yes. Without coffee, I can't get any work done all day. I feel my daily coffee intake has already gone beyond the healthy limits.

11.
You are not the only one. I will see if I can get your roast coffee delivered from my shop. If it arrives in good time, I'll let you know right away.
你不是唯一这样想的。我看看能不能从我店里给你订那款烘焙咖啡。要是能及时到，我立刻告诉你。

12.
非常感谢你。说不定你订了这些货之后，小镇上的其他居民也会很喜欢购买的。
Thank you so much. Maybe after you order these goods, the other residents in town will like buying them too.

13.
You never know. I'm glad I can help you. If you order by yourself, the delivery fee would be very high. I can get it much cheaper for you.
说不定呢。我很高兴能帮你。如果你自己订，运费会很贵。我帮你订，价格便宜得多。

14.
我觉得，这里的人一直都非常齐心协力，这也是住在小镇上最美好的事情之一。
I feel like people here always work together, and that's one of the best things about living in a small town.
