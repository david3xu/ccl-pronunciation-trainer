#70206. Easy Ways to Pick Up Our Kids - Education

1.
Hi! It's good to see you! Come on in! Everyone's here already.
嗨，很高兴见到你！进来吧——大家都到了。

2.
你好，不好意思我迟到了，你今天组织了这么盛大的活动呀。
Hi, sorry I'm late. You've organized such a grand event today.

3.
Thank you! It's been a long time since we last met. I've been thinking of arranging an afternoon tea. I hope nothing bad happened to make you late?
谢谢！我们很久没见了。我一直想安排一次下午茶。希望你不是遇到什么麻烦才迟到的？

4.
不是，完全不是。我下午计划去学校接孩子放学，所以我走路去，又走路回来的。
No, not at all. I planned to pick up my kid from school this afternoon. So I walked there and back.

5.
Sounds like a great adventure! I've never tried walking there before. It must have taken you a long time to get there and back, right?
听起来像一次大冒险！我从来没走过。你来回一定要很久吧？

6.
嗯，比我预期的要久，但路并不难走。我从公园穿过去，没有沿着主路走。
Yeah, it took longer than I expected, but the route wasn't difficult. I cut through the park instead of taking the main road.

7.
I wish I could walk with my kids like that. But I've been swamped lately. Even driving to pick them up is tough.
我真希望能这样和孩子们一起走着上学。但最近我太忙了，连开车去接他们都难。

8.
我打算经常这样做。如果你愿意，这几天我可以帮你接孩子。下午我不上班，对我来说很方便。你就不用专门跑一趟学校了。
I plan to do this regularly. If you like, I can pick up your child for you over the next few days. I'm off work in the afternoons, so it's easy for me. You wouldn't have to make a special trip to the school.

9.
Wow, that would be a huge help! I'm sure my kids would enjoy walking! It's good exercise for them. As long as you don't mind, of course. I hope it's not a bother.
哇，这真帮大忙了。我肯定孩子们会喜欢走路！对他们锻炼身体也好。当然，只要你不介意就好，我不想给你添麻烦。

10.
没问题。我在之前的学校，和另外三个家长组了个小组，轮流拼车接孩子。现在趁大家都在，我们还可以问问其他家长是否愿意加入。
No problem. At my kid's previous school, three other parents and I formed a carpool group taking turns to pick up the kids. While everyone is here now, we could ask other parents if they'd like to join.

11.
I think that's a wonderful idea! I already know a few parents here who'd be interested in joining.
我觉得这是个很棒的主意! 我已经知道这里有几位家长会有兴趣加入的。

12.
好的，我们需要组织一下，这样每个人都能清楚安排。但我不太清楚该怎么开始。
Okay, we need to organize this so everyone knows the schedule. But I'm not quite sure how to get started.

13.
We need to first find out who's interested and set up a group chat on social media to organize these things.
我们需要先看看谁有兴趣，然后在社交媒体上建个群聊来组织这些事。

14.
太棒了，建群很简单，这样每个人就能清楚具体的安排了。
Perfect. Setting up a group is easy. Then everyone will know the exact plan.
