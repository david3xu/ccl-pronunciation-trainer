#70006. School Camp Health Examination - Medical

1.
Good morning, Mr. Lin. I understand that you would like to get some information about your daughter Rebecca's medical examination, is that correct?
早上好，林先生。我知道您想了解一些关于你女儿瑞贝卡体检的事，对吗？

2.
布朗医生，您好！谢谢您抽时间见我。是的，我女儿最近要去参加学校组织的露营，学校要求上交一份关于我女儿身体状况的表格。
Hello! Thank you for taking time to see me, Dr. Brown. Yes, my daughter is going to a school camp recently. The school required us to submit a form regarding her health condition.

3.
Not a problem, I have already got her medical form. The first section in the form is about your daughter's previous medical condition. Does she have any medical history or is she having any medicine?
没问题，我已经拿到她的体检表了。表格的第一部分是有关你女儿之前的身体状况的。她有什么病史或者是有在服用什么药物吗？

4.
是的。她三岁的时候被诊断有哮喘。但是这么多年来，她的症状一直很轻微。
Yes. She was diagnosed with asthma when she was three, but her symptoms have been mild for all these years.

5.
Alright. I saw that you have kept her prescription records and she should be fine to go camping. Is she allergic to anything?
好的。我看到你保存了她的处方记录。她去野营应该是没问题的。她对什么过敏吗？

6.
我记得上次我们吃海鲜，她有点胃不舒服，后来还拉肚子了。但是我猜她应该是食物中毒了，而不是过敏。
I remember that last time we had seafood, she got an upset stomach and had diarrhea later. However, I guess it was food poisoning, instead of allergy.

7.
We'll check that later to rule out the possibility of allergy. The school also asks her to take cholesterol tests and heart rate measuring. That's something unusual.
我们会晚些来检查一下，排除掉过敏的可能性。学校还要去她测一下胆固醇和心率。这要求有点不正常了。

8.
我也觉得很奇怪。我自己去年也被要求测试过胆固醇和血糖，这我可以理解。可是我女儿还这么年轻，为什么要测她的胆固醇呢？
I find it odd too. I was asked to test my cholesterol and blood glucose levels last year. I can understand it. But my daughter is so young. Why does she need a cholesterol test?

9.
I see. The last section of the form is about giving your consent to treatment for your daughter and this requires your signature.
我了解了。表格的最后一部分是你要同意治疗你女儿，这个需要你签字。

10.
我能问一下，这个同意书是关于什么的呢？
May I ask what this consent form is about?

11.
The medical consent form ensures that even if teachers in the campsite are not able to contact you in the event of an emergency, they can still provide medical treatment to your daughter.
这个医疗同意表是为了确保如果有紧急情况发生，就算野营地的老师联系不上你，他们也可以向你女儿提供治疗。

12.
我明白了。非常感谢您，布朗医生。如果有其他问题，我再来找您。
I see. Thank you very much, Dr. Brown. I'll come to you again if I have any other questions.
