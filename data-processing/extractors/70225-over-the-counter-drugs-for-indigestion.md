#70225. Over-the-Counter Drugs for Indigestion - Medical

1.
Hi, I'm one of the pharmacists here. I noticed you looked unwell at the counter. How can I help you?
你好，我是这儿的药剂师之一。我注意到刚在柜台前你看起来不太舒服。我能怎么帮你？

2.
你好！最近，我的胃一直不舒服，好像是消化不良。我想买点药，来缓解一下。
Hi! Lately, my stomach has been upset. It feels like indigestion. I'd like some medicine to relieve it.

3.
I understand. Could you tell me more about your symptoms? For instance, do you experience any burning or nausea?
我明白。您能再详细说说症状吗？比如有没有烧心或恶心的感觉？

4.
我一吃完东西，就觉得我的胃胀胀的。有时候，我还会稍微觉得有点恶心。
After eating, I always feel bloated, and sometimes I also feel a bit nauseous.

5.
That must be quite unpleasant. Have you ever used anything for indigestion before, or is this the first time you've had these issues?
你肯定很难受吧！您以前用过什么药治疗消化不良吗，还是这是您第一次出现这样的情况？

6.
这还是头一次呢！我以前从来不胃胀的，所以我也不知道我该吃什么药。
This is the first time. My stomach has never been bloated before, so I'm not sure what medicine to take.

7.
No worries. We've got a few over-the-counter drugs for indigestion. I'd suggest trying one that lowers stomach acid.
别担心。我们有好几种非处方药可以缓解消化不良，我推荐您试试能抑制胃酸的那类药。

8.
谢谢你。这药我应该怎么吃呢？比如，是饭前吃，还是饭后吃？一天要吃几次呢？
Thank you. How should I take the medicine? For example, before or after meals, and how many times a day?

9.
For acid reducers, you can take them right after eating, or any time you start to feel discomfort.
对于抑酸药，您可以一吃完东西就服用，或者，一感觉不舒服就吃。

10.
好的，那这类药有没有什么常见的副作用呢？吃药的时候，我需要注意些什么吗？
Okay. Are there any common side effects for this type of medicine? Anything I should be aware of when I take them?

11.
Acid reducers are generally safe, though they may occasionally cause constipation or diarrhea. Most folks handle them just fine.
抑酸药通常很安全，但有时会导致便秘或腹泻。不过大多数人吃了都没事儿。

12.
了解，谢谢你的建议！我会挑一款，试用一下的。希望能快点缓解这些症状啊。
Got it, thanks for the advice. I'll pick one to try and hope it eases my symptoms soon.

13.
No problem. If you still feel off after a week, I'd recommend you see your GP to find out what's really going on.
没问题。如果一周后还不舒服，建议找全科医生看看到底怎么了。

14.
好的，我会记住的。非常感谢你的帮助！希望这药对我马上就能有效，不用再去看医生了！
Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks a lot for your help! Hopefully, this medicine works right away, and I won't need to see a doctor!
