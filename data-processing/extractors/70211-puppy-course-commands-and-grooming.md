#70211. Puppy Course: Commands & Grooming - Business

1.
Hey! I'm the lead trainer at the Dog Training Center. My coworker mentioned you just adopted an adorable male puppy. What can I help you with?
你好！我是狗狗训练中心的首席训犬师。我同事说你刚领养了一只可爱的小公狗。我能帮你些什么？

2.
你好。是的，我刚领养了一只小狗。听说你们的小狗训练课程口碑很好，我想多了解一下。
Hi! Yeah, I just adopted a puppy. I heard your puppy training course has a great reputation. I'd love to learn more.

3.
Absolutely! We offer a six-week course here that covers basic commands and hands-on handling techniques.
当然。我们这儿有个为期六周的课程，包括基本指令和实操训狗技巧。

4.
听起来很棒呀！我们家领养的小狗特别可爱的，很通人性，但也挺淘气。我想尽快让它开始上课。
That sounds great! The puppy we adopted is super cute. He is intuitive, but he is also quite naughty. I'd love to get him started with the course as soon as possible.

5.
That's a smart move! Puppies are adorable, and it's simpler to nip unwanted habits in the bud. Our next session starts in just a few days.
这个想法非常明智！小狗都很可爱，早点纠正坏习惯也会更容易。我们下期课几天后就开始了。

6.
那时间正好合适。我的孩子们经常跟小狗一起玩，所以我还想让孩子们一起参加，让他们也学学。
That's perfect timing! My kids play with the puppy all the time, so I'd love for them to join too—that way they can learn together.

7.
Absolutely! The class will teach your kids how to handle the puppy, especially how to keep him under control during walks.
当然可以。课程会教你的孩子们控犬技巧，特别是遛狗时怎么控制小狗。

8.
太好啦！我的孩子们一个十岁，一个八岁，希望他们可以学习怎么照顾小狗，比如，怎么遛狗，怎么给小狗护理毛发，怎么科学喂养。
That's amazing! My kids are ten and eight, and I hope they could learn how to take care of the puppy, you know, stuff like walking him, grooming him, and feeding him properly.

9.
Well, our course is a perfect fit then! The course also includes socialization training. We'll teach your pup how to interact with people and other animals.
嗯，那我们的课程就正合适啦。我们的课程还包社交训练，会教你家小狗怎么跟人和其他动物相处。

10.
太好啦。课程的价格是多少？课程会包含小狗笼养训练和上厕所训练吗？
That's great! How much does the course cost? And does it include crate training and potty training for the puppy?

11.
Rest assured, the course covers everything! You're in good hands! It's 200 dollars for six weeks. By the way, is your pup up to date on all his shots?
放心吧，课程内容全包的。交给我们绝对靠谱的。课程价格是六周200澳币。对了，你的小狗疫苗打全了吗？

12.
课程价格挺合理的。下一期课我们能参加吗？小狗的疫苗都打过了。兽医给我疫苗证明了。
The price sounds very reasonable. Can we join the next session? The puppy's got all his shots. The vet gave me his vaccination certificate.

13.
Perfect! Let's get the little guy signed up now. Don't forget his shot records when you attend the first lesson!
太棒啦！咱们现在就给小家伙报名吧。第一堂课别忘了带好所有疫苗证明哟！

14.
太好啦。放心，我会带着的。希望能培养出一只听话不捣蛋的小狗！
Perfect! No worries, I'll bring them. Hope we can raise a well-behaved, non-mischievous puppy!
