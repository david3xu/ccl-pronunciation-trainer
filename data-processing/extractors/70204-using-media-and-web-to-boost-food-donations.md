#70204. Using Media and Web to Boost Food Donations - Business+Social

1.
Hey, thanks for getting here on such short notice. I'd like to go over our latest numbers with you.
嗨，感谢你这么早就到了。我想和你一起过一下我们最新的数据情况。

2.
没问题！我喜欢早点开始。我之前就希望我们这周能找个时间，深入聊聊这个事。
No problem! I like to start early. I was thinking we could schedule some time this week to really dig into this.

3.
We're now serving over twice the number of people compared to two years ago, and I'm honestly worried about keeping up.
我们现在帮助的人数是两年前的两倍多，说实话我有点担心我们能不能应付得来。

4.
确实，以前主要是老人和家庭，但现在越来越多年轻人也需要我们。
It's true — while we've traditionally served seniors and families, more young people are coming to us now.

5.
I guess many folks are struggling to cover basic groceries these days. Prices have really climbed.
我猜现在很多人都难以负担基本食材。物价确实涨得厉害。

6.
要是需求这么高下去，求助的人还是这么多，咱们的库存马上就耗光了，我不知道我们该怎么做。
If the demand keeps surging like this and we keep getting so many requests, we'll burn through our inventory soon. I don't know how to handle this.

7.
We've got to brainstorm ways to boost food donations from the public. I'm sure you've got some solid ideas.
咱们得想办法多提高公众的食物捐赠。我相信你肯定有好点子。

8.
我们可以发起社交媒体捐赠活动，还可以用新闻报道来宣传，呼吁大家多捐款和食物，来充实我们的食品库。
We could start a social media donation campaign and get news coverage to spread the word. Let's ask people to donate more money and food to stock up our food bank.

9.
If we can get the local TV station to cover this, we might even make the news. That would really help!
要是能让本地电视台报道一下，说不定还能上新闻呢，那就帮大忙了！

10.
好主意！借助新闻扩大影响力，能覆盖到比我们直接接触还更广泛的人群。
Good idea! Using news to expand influence can cover a wider crowd than we could reach directly.

11.
We could also add a page to our website explaining that volunteers run the pantry, so more funds go directly to food.
咱们还可以在官网上加个页面，说明食品库是志愿者运营的，这样更多钱就能直接买食物了。

12.
我们还可以在网站放上一些我们的照片，比如志愿者工作照，让人看到大家热心做事的样子。在这儿工作的人也会乐意一直帮助我们。
We could also post some photos on our website—like volunteers in action—to show people how passionate everyone is. The folks working here would be happy to keep helping out too!

13.
Love that! I really appreciate all you have done! None of this happens without your effort.
太棒了！我非常感激你所有的付出。要不是你，咱们这儿根本做不起来。

14.
收到感谢真的很有成就感！希望捐赠可以源源不断，这样我们就能帮到更多有需要的人啦。
It's so rewarding to be appreciated! Hopefully, the donations will keep coming so we can support more people in need.
