#70197. Police Call About House Invasion - Legal

1.
Hi. You've reached the Australian Police Assistance Hotline. This is Officer Williams speaking. How may I be of service today?
你好，你已拨通澳大利亚警察求助热线，我是警官威廉姆斯。今天有什么可以为你效劳的吗？

2.
警察同志你好。我家突然有人闯进来了，我现在完全不知道该怎么办才好。
Hello, officer. Someone broke into my house, and I really have no idea what to do now.

3.
Alright, the most important thing is your safety. First, ensure you're okay and if anyone is still inside, please stay out.
好的，最重要的是确保您的安全。首先，确认您没事，如果家里还有人，请不要进去。

4.
目前家里已经没有人了。我刚到家时发现房里空荡荡的没人，但明显看得出之前有人来过。太吓人了。
Now there's nobody inside. I just got home and found the place empty with no one inside, but it's clear someone was there earlier. It's so scary.

5.
I see. Please try to keep calm and start from the beginning. Can you explain what happened?
我明白。请尽量保持冷静，从头开始跟我说说到底发生了什么？

6.
好的，我尽量平复一下我的情绪吧。我刚刚旅游回来，发现家里被翻得乱七八糟。而且，洗衣房的窗户被砸破了！
Okay, I'll try to calm down. I just got back from a trip and found my home completely ransacked. The laundry room window also got smashed!

7.
It appears they gained entry by smashing the laundry room window. I know this situation is chaotic, but could you check if anything has been stolen?
他们可能是通过砸破洗衣房的窗户闯进去的。我知道情况很混乱，但你能否确认一下有没有东西被盗走？

8.
哎呀，我还没来得及细看所有的东西呢，因为我第一时间就打电话给你们了。不过，我发现电视和立体声音响不见了，而且还有一台电脑也没了。
Oh boy. I haven't had the chance to look over everything in detail since I called you immediately. However, I noticed the TV is gone, the stereo is gone, and a computer is missing.

9.
Alright, please refrain from tidying up or touching anything at the scene. I'll dispatch an officer to your residence so you can file a report regarding the stolen items.
好的，请不要清理或碰动现场的任何东西。我会派一名警官到您家，让您报案记录被盗物品的情况。

10.
天啊，我真是难以置信会有人做出这种事。虽然我家里没有特别贵重的东西，但要重新买回这些东西还是很麻烦啊。
Oh my god. I really can't believe someone would do something like this. Even though I don't have any highly valuable items at home, replacing these things is still a hassle.

11.
If your home and belongings are insured, your insurance should help cover the cost of replacing the stolen items. Also, could you check if anything else is missing?
如果您的房屋和物品都有保险，保险应该可以帮您赔偿更换被盗的物品。另外，您能再确认一下是否还有别的东西被偷了吗？

12.
对对对，我竟然忘了我还有保险！保险肯定能帮上忙。要是可以的话，我想等警察来了以后，我再详细检查整个房子。
Oh right! I can't believe I forgot about my insurance! It definitely should help. If possible, I'd prefer to check the entire house carefully after the police arrive.

13.
Definitely, it's a smart idea to wait inside your car until the police show up so nothing gets disturbed. It won't take much time.
当然，最好是在车里等到警察到达，这样可以确保不破坏现场。时间不会太久的。

14.
非常感谢你们帮忙。回家看到这种情况，真是我最不想遇到的。你们的帮助实在是救了我一命啊。
Thank you so much for your help. This is the last thing I ever wanted to see when I got home, your assistance has truly been a lifesaver.
