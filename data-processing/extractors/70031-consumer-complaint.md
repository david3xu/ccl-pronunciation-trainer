#70031. Consumer Complaint - Business

1.
Hello, this is Jenny from Consumer Affairs. How can I help you today?
你好，我是消费者事务署的Jenny。我今天能怎么帮到你呢？

2.
你好。我现在心情特别烦躁。我在一家大商店买了电脑，我想投诉他们。
Hi. I'm very upset now. I bought a computer from a big store and I want to make a complaint.

3.
I'm sorry to hear that. Could you please tell me what happened? We'll see what we can do for you.
很抱歉听到这个。你能告诉我们发生了什么吗？我们帮看看能不能为你做点什么。

4.
我儿子要上大学了。我想给我儿子买台电脑。卖电脑的一个售货员叫Tom，他建议我给儿子买最好的电脑。他说虽然这个电脑贵，但是我能申请贷款。
My son is about to go to university, and I'd like to buy a computer for him. This salesman, Tom, suggested buying the best one for my son. He said that although it was expensive, I could apply for a loan.

5.
I can totally understand that. Did you sign any documents?
我完全可以理解的。你有签什么文件吗？

6.
那个叫TOM的有拿纸质文件，合同什么的，让我在上面签字。
That salesman, Tom, brought me some printed documents, contracts and the like, and then he asked me to sign them.

7.
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened next?
听到这个我很抱歉。之后发生了什么呢？

8.
我当时其实犹豫了。Tom说商店马上关门了，如果我不赶快决定，今天就不能把电脑带回家。他还说我儿子看到电脑一定会非常高兴的。我就签字了。
Actually, I hesitated. Tom said the store was closing soon and I wouldn't be able to take the computer home if I didn't decide fast. He also said that my son would be thrilled to see the computer. So, I signed.

9.
It seems that you made this decision under pressure. Complaints like this happen every now and then in Australia.
似乎你是在压力下做了这个决定的。像这样的投诉在澳洲时不时有发生。

10.
我当时还很高兴。想着给我儿子一个惊喜。但是我在火车上看文件的时候就惊呆了。我英语虽然不好，但是也看出来我没办法偿还。我都没有跟我儿子说。
I was over the moon at that time, thinking about surprising my son. I was shocked when I was reading those documents on the train. Despite my poor English, I could still tell that I would never be able to pay the money back. I didn't even tell my son.

11.
That sounds really unfair. We can help you with this situation. First, let me take down all the details and then we'll contact the store directly.
听起来真的不公平。我们可以帮你处理这种情况。首先，让我记录下所有细节，然后我们会直接联系这家店。

12.
真的吗？这太好了。我真的很后悔签了那些文件。
Really? That's great. I really regret signing those documents.
