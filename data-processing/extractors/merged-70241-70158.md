#70241. Suite Bathroom Design Clarification–Business

1.  _Hey, the office mentioned_ | _you'd drop by_ _to visit the site again today_. | _I bet you'll be pleased with the progress_.
    嗨，办公室那边说 | 你今天要再来工地一趟。| 我相信你会对进度满意的。

2.  对啊，我就在附近上班，| 顺路过来看看挺方便的。| 看着新房子一点点盖起来，我超激动的。
    _Yeah, I work nearby_ | _so it's easy to swing by_. | _I'm thrilled_ _watching my new house_ _take shape_.

3.  _The crew has now_ _finished the walls, floors, and doors_. | _The supplier_ _has finally delivered the materials_ _early last week_.
    施工队/工人们现在已经做完墙壁、地板和门了。| 上周早些时候，供应商总算把材料送到了。

4.  速度真快！| 因为材料送过来的时间延期了，| 我本来还以为需要更长的时间呢。| 现在材料好像都很难买，| 运输也很慢。
    _That was quick_! | _Since the material delivery was delayed_, | _I thought it would take longer_. | _Nowadays it seems really hard_ _to get materials_, | _and shipping is so slow too_.

5.  _True, and material prices_ _have gone up too_. | _Since you're here_, | _I'd like to go over the plans with you_.
    没错，材料现在也涨价了。| 既然你来了，| 我想和你一起过一下图纸。

6.  没问题。| 我感觉我每天晚上回家都会看施工图纸。| 所以每个房间具体会是什么样子的，我都清清楚楚。
    _No problem_. | _I feel like_ _I check the construction plans every night_ _when I get home_. | _So, I know exactly_ _what each room will look like_.

7.  _The plumber's working on_ _the suite bathroom now_. | _I just want to double-check_ _you haven't changed the plan for it_.
    现在水管工在弄套房的浴室。| 我只是想再次确认一下你没有改那一块的图纸。

8.  我没改。| 我希望没有什么问题。| 我那个套间的浴室是围绕着一个精美的老式浴缸而设计的。
    _No changes_. | _I hope there won't be any issues_. | _The bathroom in my suite_ _is designed around_ _a beautiful vintage bathtub_.

9.  _I'll need to speak with him_. | _He was going to_ _include a shower in the bathroom_. | _But he hasn't started yet_. | _There shouldn't be any problems_.
    我得跟他聊聊。| 他打算在浴室加个淋浴。| 不过他还没开始弄呢。| 应该没问题。

10. 我很喜欢泡澡，| 所以我绝对不想在套间的浴室装淋浴。| 我们的主浴室已有一个淋浴间了。
    _I really enjoy soaking in the bath_, | _so I absolutely don't want a shower_ _in my suite's bathroom_. | _Our master bathroom already has_ _a shower stall_.

11. _It struck me_ _as a bit strange this morning_. | _That's why_ _I inspect the site every day_.
    我今早上看着就突然觉得有点怪/不对劲，| 这也是为什么我每天都要到工地检查的原因。

12. 太感谢了，| 让我放心多了。| 你这么快就能发现和解决问题，真的太棒了。
    _Thanks so much_. | _That really puts my mind at ease_. | _It's so great you can_ _catch and fix issues promptly_.

13. _Of course_.| _I believe in looking after my customers_, | _and I know how important it is_ _to keep track of everything_.
    当然。我是客户至上的/我坚信得把客户服务好，| 而且我也知道每件事都把控好/跟进好/盯紧了有多重要。

14. 设计这个房子有这么多的事情要做呀！| 我不知道盖一个房子需要这么复杂。
    _There are so many things to do_ _when designing this house_! | _I had no idea_ _building a house_ _could be this complicated_.

#70240. A New Creamy Leather Lounge Chair - Business

1.  _Hey, great to see you_! | _We've finally got a chance_ _to catch up_.
    嘿，好高兴见到你！| 我们终于有机会聚一聚了。

2.  对啊，咱们好久没坐下来慢慢喝咖啡聊聊天了。
    _Yeah, it's been ages_ _since we last sat down_ _to enjoy coffee and chat_.

3.  _How's your day going_? | _You mentioned_ _you were browsing the mall_ _before coming here to meet me_.
    你今天过得怎么样？| 你说你来这跟我见面之前还在逛商场呢。

4.  对，我就是想买把新休闲椅，| 所以一直在商场里逛，| 想挑个质感好的。
    _Yeah, I just want to buy_ _a new lounge chair_, | _so I've been looking around the mall_ | _for one that feels really nice_.

5.  _That's awesome_. | _Big stores have loads of options_. | _But furniture can be expensive_, | _depending on what you want_.
    那太好了。| 大商场的选择多得很。| 不过家具可不便宜啊，| 这要看你想要什么样的了。

6.  我看上了一款奶油色皮质沙发，很对我胃口，可价格不算低。| 我不太确定最划算的付款方式是怎样的。
    _I spotted_ _a cream-colored leather sofa_ _that I really like_, _but it isn't cheap_. | _I'm not sure_ _which payment method _makes the most sense_.

7. _You could go with one of those_ _'Buy Now, Pay Later' services_. | _Nowadays almost every store offers them_.
    你可以选择那种'先买后付'服务，| 现 在几乎所有店都有这种选项。

8.  要是可以分次付款，就太棒了。| 这样的话，我就能立刻把皮沙发搬回家了。
    _It'd be great to split the payment_, | _then I could_ _take the leather sofa home_ _right away_.

9. _True, but watch out for extra fees_, | and _skipping an installment payment_ _could affect your credit score_.
    没错，不过要留意额外费用，| 漏交一笔分期付款还可能影响你的信用记录。

10. 我知道对于这种'先买后付'要谨慎点，| 可是感觉挺适合我的。| 毕竟，我只买这一件东西。
    _I get_ _that 'Buy Now, Pay Later' needs caution_, | _but I feel_ _it might work well for me_.| _After all, I'm only_ _buying this one thing_.

11. _It's smart to think about_ _your best payment options_ _for big purchases_. | _You could save money_ _or make it easier to pay_.
    考虑一下大额消费的最佳付款方式是明智的。| 你可能可以省钱，或者让付款更轻松。

12. 我也这么觉得。我今晚好好比对一下，| 再明天去店里决定。| 我觉得这沙发放客厅肯定很棒。
    _I agree_._I'll carefully compare them tonight | _and decide at the store tomorrow_. | _I bet that sofa_ _would look fantastic_ _in the living room_.

13. _Creamy leather_ | _sounds a perfect choice_. | _How about we_  _grab a slice of cake_ _with our coffee to celebrate_?
    奶油色的皮革，| 这选择听着太完美了。| 要不咱俩喝咖啡时再加块蛋糕，庆祝一下？

14. 听起来很完美。我逛完这一圈，肚子都饿扁了。| 希望一切都顺利。
    _Sounds perfect_. _I'm starving_ _after all that shopping_. | _Hope it all works out_.

1.  _Hi, it's great to see you_. _It feels like ages_ _since our last chat_. | _Have you been away_ _or just super busy_? | _How have you been keeping_?
    嗨，见到你真高兴。感觉上次聊天过去好久了。| 你最近是出门了，还是单纯特别忙？| 最近怎么样啊？

2.  是啊，有一段时间了。| 最近一直在装修我的房子，现在终于完工了。| 整个过程很累，但是值得。
    _Yeah, it's been a while_. | _I've been renovating my house_, _and it's finally done now_. | _The entire process is tiring_ _but it is totally worth it_.

3.  _Great! I remember seeing your plans_! | _It was a massive job_. | _Really glad_ _it went smoothly for you_. | _The final result must be_ _so satisfying_!
    太好了！我记得看过你的设计图，| 工程特别大。| 真高兴你一切顺利。| 最后效果一定很满意吧！

    _Everything went well_. | _Luckily, we found a reliable builder_. | _The major work is done_, | _and the decorating part_ _is more fun_!

5.  _True, it must be overwhelming_ _with all those decisions_. | _Picking finishes_ _takes real patience_!
    是啊，做这么多决定肯定很头疼。| 选装修材料可得有耐心！

6.  我们一次只装修一个房间，| 这样就更容易管理。| 而且不用赶时间，我们可以慢慢琢磨。
    _We're doing one room at a time_ | _to keep it more manageable_. | _No rush_. _We can take our time_ _to think things through_.

7.  _That's smart_. _Taking your time_ _ensures the house turns out just right_. | _Which room are you tackling now_?
    这法子聪明。| 慢慢来才能把房子装出理想效果。你们现在弄哪个房间？

8.  我们在装修时，弄了个大阁楼。现在准备把它做成家庭办公室，那里的自然光线特别好。
    _During the renovation_, _we added a spacious loft_. | _Now we plan to_ _turn it into a home office_. _The natural light there is perfect_!

9.  _Those massive windows_ must give amazing natural light! | Perfect for an office. Have you _picked out a desk_ yet?
    大窗户，采光肯定超棒！做办公室绝了。桌子选好了吗？

10. 家具全用素净的颜色，| 不选深色桌子。| 另外我还打算装百叶窗。
    _All furniture is in neutral colours_, | _no dark desks_. | _Plus, I plan to add blinds_.

11. _Good call_! | _Making sure you are happy with it_ _for years is important_! | _You don't want to_ _redecorate again too soon_.
    明智的选择！| 确保这个装修能让你喜欢很多年是很重要的，| 谁都不想太快重新装修一遍。

12. 我同意你说的。| 所以，我们会用简单素净的设计，| 然后用小地毯这种容易换的小东西来增加一些鲜艳的色彩。
    _I agree_. | _That's why we'll go for_ _simple and neutral designs_ | _and add some bright colors_ _with easy-to-swap items like rugs_.

13. _Love that idea_! | _Seriously can't wait to see it finished_. | _You must send me photos_! | _I bet it's going to look fantastic_!
    这主意好！| 真是都等不及想看成果了！| 你一定得发照片给我！| 我觉得肯定会超级好看！

14. 我也等不及请你来参观了！| 不过，还得等一阵子，| 收尾工作比预想耗时。| 我也不想太赶了。
    _Can't wait to show you either_! | _Still need some time though_ | – _the finishing touches_ _are taking longer than expected_. | _I don't want to rush it either_.

#70238. Ordering Oat Milk in a Small Town - Business

1. _Hi, it's nice to see you_. | _I hope you've settled in_! | _Living in a small town_ _must be a big change_. | _Have you gotten used to_ _the quieter pace yet_?
    嗨，很高兴见到你。| 希望你已经安顿好了！| 住在这么小的镇上肯定是大变化。| 你适应了这种更悠闲的节奏了吗？

2.  你好！是的，我从来没住过这么小的地方，| 而且这儿离城里又很远。| 不过邻居们都特别热情。
    _Hello, yes, I've never lived in_ _such a small place_, | _and it's quite a distance from the city_. | _But the neighbours have been_ _really welcoming_.

3.  _It is. It takes a while_ _to get to the city_ _and a while to get used to everything here_. | _I hope the sense of community_ _can make up for it_.
    确实，去城里要花点时间，这里的生活节奏也要慢慢适应。| 我希望这里的社区氛围能弥补这些不便。

4.  对，我发现小镇上的人都很友好，| 我通过工作，已经认识了大半个镇上的人。| 这种亲切感在大城市里可体验不到。
    _Yes, I've found that_ _people in this town are very friendly_, | _and through work_ _I've already met most of them_. | _You'd never get that kind of warmth_ _in a big city_!

5.  _Everyone got excited_ _when the new doctor arrived_. | _The previous doctor_ _moved back to the city_, | _and it took a long time_ _before the replacement showed up_.
    新的医生一来大家都很兴奋。| 之前的医生搬回城里，| 换医生又等了好一阵子。

6.  我现在不打算搬回城里，| 但是，我确实很想念城里的东西，尤其是那些商店。| 想买什么都能在一个商场里搞定。
    _I'm not planning to_ _move back to the city_, | _but I do miss city amenities_, _especially those shops_. | _You could get everything in one shopping centre_.

7.  _I understand_. _I can order some grocery items for you _from my suppliers_ | _if they're things you buy regularly_ | _but we don't have them in stock_.
    我明白。如果你经常买的日用品我们没有库存，| 我可以帮你从我供应商那里订购。

8.  太好了，我都不知道你可以这样做，| 我有过敏，所以我更喜欢喝燕麦奶。| 但是现在快喝完了。
    _Great, I didn't realize you could do that_. | _I have allergies_, _so I prefer oat milk_. | _But mine's almost gone_.

9.  _Okay, most people in this town_ _buy dairy or soy milk_, | _so I have them in stock_. _But I think I can order oat milk for you from my supplier_.
    好的，这里大多数人喝乳制品或豆奶，| 所以这些都有货。不过我想我可以从我供应商那里给你订燕麦奶。

10. 太好了。如果可以的话，我一周需要消耗两升燕麦奶。| 我通常会每两周购买一次。
    _Great. If possible, I use about_ _two litres of oat milk per week_. | _I usually buy it every two weeks_.

11. _That should be fine_. _I restock_every one to two weeks_, | _so I'll make sure to order enough_. | _I'll see if I can_ _have your oat milk_ _delivered along with my other goods.
    应该没问题。我每一到两周补货一次，| 所以我会确保订够量的。| 我会看看能不能把你的燕麦奶和我的其他货一起送来。

12. 太感谢了，真的谢谢你。| 说不定你订了燕麦奶以后，| 镇上其他人也会跟着买呢。
    _Thanks so much, I really appreciate it_. | _If you order oat milk_, | _maybe other people in the town_ _will buy it too_.

13. _You never know. I'm happy to help_. _If you order yourself_, _the delivery fee will be very high_, | _but I can get it cheaper for you_.
    谁知道呢。我很乐意帮忙。| 如果你自己下单，运费会很贵，| 但我可以帮你拿到更便宜的价格。

14. 感谢你！我发现，小镇上的人们都很团结互助，| 这是住在这里最美好的事情之一。
    _Thank you! I've found that people in this town_ _really stick together_. | _This is one of the best things_ _about living here_.

1.  _Hi there! Thanks for calling our bank_. | _We're here to make your banking experience_ _as smooth as possible_. | _What can I do for you today_?
    你好！感谢致电我们银行。| 我们致力于让您的银行业务体验更加顺畅。| 今天有什么可以为您效劳的吗？

2.  我刚移民到澳大利亚不久，在你们银行开了户。| 现在碰到些问题，想跟您咨询下。| 毕竟，这边的流程和国内不太一样。
    _I recently migrated to Australia_ _and opened an account with your bank_. | _Now I've run into some issues_, _and I'd like to ask you_. | _The process here_ _is different from back home_.

3.  _Absolutely! Ask me anything about your bank account_! _I'm here to help_. | _Banking systems do vary between countries_, | _so it's totally normal_ _to have questions_.
    当然！关于银行账户的问题尽管问我！我都可以帮您解答。| 各国银行系统确实不同，| 有疑问非常正常。

4.  确实，很多事都挺陌生的。| 我在努力适应了，可是，我老是担心我问的问题太傻，| 怪不好意思的。
    _Yeah, lots of things feel unfamiliar here_. | _I'm trying to adapt_, _but I keep worrying my questions_ _sound silly_. | _It's quite embarrassing_.

5.  _No stress at all_! _When you're new to something_, | _every question matters_. | _We're here to help you sort things out_. | _So, what's been on your mind_?
    千万别有压力！刚接触新事物时，|v 每个问题都很重要。| 我们就是帮您解决问题的。| 所以，您遇到什么情况了？

6.  我老是搞不清楚账单什么时候该付。| 一忙起来，就忘了缴款。| 跟上各种账单的缴费实在是太难了。| 这问题困扰我好一阵子了。
    _I'm always confused about_ _when bills are due_, | _and when I get busy_, _I completely forget to pay them_. | _Keeping up with bill payments is so hard_. | _This has been bothering me_ _for quite a while_.

7.  _Why not set up_ _automatic payment_? | _Just authorize direct debit_. | _Then the bills get paid on time_ _without you lifting a finger_.
    您不妨开通自动扣款？| 您只需要授权，| 然后账单会按时支付，完全不用您操心。

8.  自动扣款？听上去不错。| 这个功能可以在我的手机银行应用里自己操作吗？| 还是需要您帮我激活？
    _Direct debit? Sounds good_. | _Can I do this myself_ _on my mobile banking app_? | _Or do you need to_ _activate it for me_?

9.  _Actually, you'll need to_ _give your payment details_ _to the company billing you_. | _They're the ones_ _who manage your payment collection_. | _I can't set that up_ _from our end_.
    实际上，您需要把付款信息提供给给您发账单的公司。| 他们负责收款。| 我在我们银行端操作不了这个。

10. 知道这个方法后，办银行业务会顺手很多呀。| 我开始习惯网上支付了。| 用手机付款我也越来越得心应手啦。
    _Got it! Knowing this method_ _would make banking way easier_. | _I'm getting used to_ _online payments now_. | _I'm getting more comfortable with_ _mobile payments_!

11. _Our mobile app actually has_ _multiple payment methods built in_. | _You'll find it super convenient_ _to handle everything on your own_, | _such as managing all your bill payments_.
    我们的手机应用其实内置了好几种付款方式。| 您完全可以自己轻松搞定所有支付操作，| 比如管理所有账单的支付。

12. 手机银行是挺方便，| 可我偶尔还是怀念去分行找柜员面对面聊的感觉。| 刚来这里啥都不熟悉那会儿，| 这种感觉特别强烈。
    _Mobile banking is convenient_, | _but occasionally I still miss_ _chatting face-to-face with_ _a bank teller in a branch_. | _Back when I first arrived_ _and everything felt unfamiliar_, | _that feeling was especially strong_.

13. _Totally get that_! _Just know our hotline's always open_! | _Any confusion_, _give us a ring right away_. | _We've got staff ready twenty-four seven_ _to answer any banking questions_.
    完全理解！记住我们热线随时畅通！| 有任何不清楚马上给我们打电话。| 我们全天候都有工作人员，帮您解答任何银行业务问题。

14. 真的太感谢您的帮助了！| 您让一切变得简单多了。| 后续，要是遇到问题，我肯定第一时间联系您。| 说真的，今天您的耐心让我特别感激！
    _Thanks a ton for your help_! | _You've made everything so much easier_. | _If anything comes up later_, _I'll contact you first_. | _Seriously,  I really appreciate your patience today_!

    你好，快请进！我听说你在打听志愿者机会。| 我们很乐意多给你讲讲怎么参与。

2.  对的，我刚搬来一个月左右。想找点事儿做，| 好尽快熟悉这一片儿。| 毕竟新地方嘛，多认识点邻居挺好的。
    _Yep, I just moved here_ _about a month ago_. | _Trying to find things to do_ _to get to know the area sooner_. | _After all, it's a new place_ _and it's nice to meet more neighbors_.

3.  _We're always looking for people_ _to help out with our activities_. | _Honestly, volunteers help everything_ _we do here_. | _We really couldn't manage without them_!
    我们一直在找人给活动帮忙。| 说真的，我们所有工作都有志愿者帮忙。| 没有他们真忙不过来。

4.  我在家办公，所以时间安排挺自由的。| 每周都能抽出几个小时帮忙。| 说实话，我主要想多认识些人。
    _I work from home_, _so my schedule's pretty flexible_. | _I can spare a few hours_ _every week to volunteer_. | _Honestly, I mainly want to_ _meet more new people_.

5.  _Absolutely! Lots of our volunteers_ _end up becoming friends_. | _Is there anything specific_ _you enjoy doing_? | _We'll try to match you with a project_ _that suits your hobbies_.
    当然！很多志愿者最后都成了朋友。| 你有什么特别喜欢做的吗？| 我们会尽量按你的兴趣匹配项目。

6.  我什么都愿意试试，不过我确实特别喜欢园艺，还有种植。| 最近，我还在家搞了个小菜园呢。
    _I'm open to anything_, _but I'm indeed into gardening_ _and planting stuff_. | _I've been working on_ _a little veggie garden at home lately_.

7.  _That's perfect! We actually have an ideal project_. | _We're fixing up that park_ _next to the mall_. | _Your skills would be a great fit there_.
    真好！实际上我们有个项目很合适。| 我们在修缮商场旁边那个公园。| 你的特长在那儿完全能用上。

8.  我都不知道那儿有个公园呢，| 一直以为就是块空地。| 这消息还挺让人惊喜的！
    _I had no idea there was a park there_ – | _I always thought_ _it was just an empty lot_. | _That's really nice to hear_!

9.  _Right now, we need helpers to look after_ _the seedlings in our shed_ | _before planting them in the park_. | _When they're strong enough_, _they'll be moved to the park_.
    现在，我们需要帮手在我们的棚子里照看那些树苗，| 之后再把它们种到公园里。| 等它们长得足够结实了，就挪到公园里去。

10. 这事儿我能行！种本地植物，我特别乐意帮忙。| 而且我能看出这个公园修缮后一定会很漂亮。
    _I can totally do this_! _Planting native plants_—_I'd be really happy to help_. | _And I can tell this park will look so nice_ _once it's fixed up_.

11. _It's a big project for sure_, _but it'll be worth it_ _when we see the results_. | _We'll also be installing some benches_ _so people can relax there_.
    工程肯定不小，但看到成果就值了。| 我们还会装些长椅，方便大家休息。

12. 公园对咱们社区居民可重要了。| 大伙儿总得有个地方散步，| 或者单纯坐着透透气吧。
    _Parks are quite important to people_ _in our community_. | _Everyone needs a spot_ _to take walks_ | _or just sit and get some fresh air_.

13. _Definitely! We got really lucky to have raised_ _lots of community donations_ _to restore the park. | _The whole neighborhood's_ _keen to see it open again_.

#70235. Late Fee and Direct Debit - Business

1.  _Hi! Thank you for calling our bank_. | _My name is Dylan from Customer Support_. | _Please be aware_ _that this call may be recorded_ _for quality and training purposes_.
    您好！感谢致电我们银行。我是客户支持的迪伦。请注意，为保证服务质量和培训目的，您的通话可能会被录音。

2.  早上好。我刚收到一张账单，上面说我欠了"滞纳金"。| 我明明记得付过钱了！这到底是怎么回事？
    _Good morning. I just received a bill_ _saying I owe a "late payment fee"_. | _I'm sure I paid it_! _What's exactly going on_?

3.  _I understand that can be frustrating_. | _Let me check your account history_ _for that biller_. | _To help me, could you tell me_ _how you made the payment_?
    我理解这很令人沮丧。| 让我查一下您对该收款方的账户记录。| 方便告诉我您是怎么付款的吗？

4.  我是用你们手机银行的应用付的。| 真怀念能去银行分行当面跟柜员聊聊啊，| 这样我直接拿手机给柜员看就行了。
    _I paid it_ _using your bank's app_. | _I really miss_ _being able to just go into a branch_ _and talk to a clerk face-to-face_. | _Then I could just_ _show them what's on my phone_.

5.  _Don't worry. Looking at the dates_, _it seems you paid on the due date_. | _For some billers_, _the payment might not be processed_ _until the next business day_.
    别担心。看日期，您好像是在到期日当天付的款。| 对一些收款方来说，款项可能要到下一个工作日才处理。

6.  我当天付了钱，只是处理晚了，| 收款方没在截止时间前收到。| 现在我就得付那个滞纳金？这太不合理了！
    _I paid on the day_. _It was just that_ _the processing was late_, | _and the biller didn't receive it_ _before the deadline_. | _Now I have to pay that late fee_? _That seems unfair_!

7.  _Unfortunately, that's correct_ _according to the biller's terms. | _To avoid this in the future_, _I strongly recommend_ _setting up a direct debit_.
    很遗憾，根据收款方的条款，确实如此。| 为了避免将来再发生这种情况，我强烈建议您设置直接扣款。

8.  直接扣款？意思是，钱自动从我的账户划走？| 这样安全吗？万一金额错了，怎么办？
    _Direct debit? _Meaning_ _the money is taken out of my account_ _automatically_? | _Is that safe_? _What if the amount is wrong_?

9.  _With direct debit_, | _you authorise the biller_ _to take the payment directly_ _from your account_. | _It's very secure_ _and ensures you_ _never miss a payment_.
    使用直接扣款，| 您授权收款方直接从您的账户扣款。| 这非常安全，确保您永远不会错过付款。

10. 听起来不错。那不能设置直接扣款的账单呢？| 比如，我的网费账单好像就不行。我还有其他选择吗？
    _That sounds good_. _What about those bills_ _that can't be set up for direct debit_? | _Like my internet bill_, _I don't think_ _it lets me set that up_. _Do I have other options_?

11. _You can use BPAY_. | _It's a very common way to pay bills in Australia_ _through online banking_ _or our app_. | _You'll find_ _the unique biller code_ _on your bill_.
    您可以使用账单支付服务。| 这是在澳大利亚通过网上银行或我们的应用来支付账单的常用方式。| 您可以在账单上找到唯一的收款方代码。

12. 明白了。那我下次最好提前几天付款，| 或者用直接扣款或账单支付服务，| 对吧？这样就不会再有滞纳金了。
    _Got it. So next time_, _I should pay a few days early_, | _or use direct debit_ _or BPAY, right_? | _Then there won't be any more_ _late fees_.

13. _That's exactly right_! _You can find guides for both methods_ _on our website_ _or in our app_. | _Would you like me_ _to email you the links_?
    完全正确！您可以在我们网站上或应用里找到这两种方法的指南。| 需要我把链接发邮件给您吗？

14. 请发给我吧！ 谢谢你一切都解释得这么清楚。| 我现在知道该怎么避免滞纳金了。| 这样一来，办理银行业务就方便多了。
    _Please send them_! _Thank you for_ _explaining everything so clearly_. | _I know_ _how to avoid late fees now_. | _This makes banking_ _much more convenient_.

#70234. Small Town Doctor & Grocer - Social

1.  _Hello! Good to see you_. _It was a relief_ _when you arrived_ | _after the previous doctor_ _decided to move back to the city_. | _We were worried about_ _being without a doctor for too long_.
    你好！很高兴见到你。你能来真让我们松了口气。| 之前的医生决定搬回城里后，| 我们之前还担心会很久没有医生呢。

2.  谢谢！我很高兴能有机会接手这个诊所，为大家服务。| 虽然说，小镇的生活和我以前习惯的生活很不一样。
    _Thank you! I'm very happy_ _to have the opportunity_ to take over this clinic_ _and serve everyone_. | _Although_ _life in this small town_ _is quite different from_ _what I was used to_ _before_.

3.  _We are really grateful_ _that you came_. | _Having a doctor right here_ _who knows us_ _makes all the difference_, | _especially_ for the little check-ups and advice_.
    我们真的很感激你能来。| 身边有个了解我们的医生太重要了，| 特别是日常检查和小毛病咨询。

4.  这半年多来，我也在努力熟悉每一位病人和他们的健康情况。| 这种紧密的联系，在大城市的医院里，是很难建立的。
    _Over the past six months or so_, _I've been working hard_ _to get to know each patient_ _and their health situation_. | _This kind of close connection_ _is hard to establish_ _in big city hospitals_.

5.  _We're lucky to have you_. _So, apart from the medical side_, | _how are you finding life here overall_? _Anything you miss_?
    我们有你很幸运。那么，除了医疗工作，| 你觉得这里的生活怎么样？有什么想念的东西吗？

6.  整体上，我很喜欢这里的安静和友善。| 不过，日常生活里的一些小习惯，比如一些吃的喝的，| 这里的选择就少多了。
    _Overall, I really like the peacefulness_ _and friendliness here_. | _However, for some small daily habits_, _like certain food and drinks_, | _the choices here_ _are much more limited_.

7.  _That's where_ _my little shop comes in_! | _If there's something specific_ _you need regularly_ _that we don't stock, just tell me_. | _I can usually_ _get them through my suppliers_.
    这就是我的小店发挥作用的地方了！| 如果有什么你常用的，但我们店里没有的东西，直接告诉我一声。| 我通常能通过供应商拿到货。

8.  太好了，我们刚搬来时，| 买了几罐茉莉花茶和 | 几瓶辣椒酱。| 但是现在，快半年了，都快见底了。
    _Great! When we first moved here_, | _we bought_ _a few jars of jasmine tea_ | _and a few bottles_ _of chili sauce_. | _But now, after almost half a year_, _they're almost gone_.


9.  _I heard_ _from your receptionist_ | _that you have a really nice_ _porcelain tea set_ _at the doctor's clinic_. | _You must be really missing your favourite tea_ _and that spicy kick_!
    我从你前台那里听说，| 你在诊所有套很漂亮的瓷器茶具。| 你肯定很想念你最喜欢的茶和那种辣味的刺激感吧！

10. 是的啊。没有茶提神醒脑，| 也没有辣酱开胃下饭，| 我感觉我一天的工作都没法干利索。
    _Yes, exactly_. _Without tea_ _to refresh my mind_ | _and chili sauce_ _to stimulate_ _my appetite for meals_, | _I feel like_ _I can't get my day's work done_ _properly_.

11. _Consider it done_. _That lovely tea set_ _deserves the perfect brew_. | _I'll put in an order_ _for your preferred jasmine tea_ _and chili sauce_ _first thing tomorrow_.
    包在我身上。那么漂亮的茶具就该配上好茶。| 我明天一早就给你订你喜欢的茉莉花茶和辣椒酱。

12. 你真是太贴心了！小镇的人也都很好！| 前天晚上，诊所有个小状况，| 镇上几位邻居马上就来帮忙了，让我特别感动。
    _You're so thoughtful_! _The people in town are really wonderful too_! | _Just the night before last_, _there was a small issue_ _at the clinic_, | _and several neighbors_ _came over immediately_ _to help_. | _It really touched me_.

13.  _That's just how we do things_ _around here_. | _Folks_ _look out for each other_, | _especially_ _for someone like you_ _who's become so important_ _to us all_.
    我们这儿的人就是这样。| 大家互相照应，| 特别是对你这样对我们所有人都很重要的人。

14. 谢谢你！就是这些点点滴滴的小事，让我觉得这里不只是一个工作的地方，| 更像一个可以扎根的家。
    _Thank you_! _It's these little things_ _that make me feel_ _this place isn't just a workplace_, | _but more like a home_ _where I can stay for good_.

#70233. Excavator Theft - Business

1.  _You've reached_ _the police non-emergency line_. | _If it's life-threatening_, _hang up and dial triple zero_. | _Otherwise, I'm here to take your report_.
    您已拨通警察非紧急热线。| 如果是人命关天的事，请挂断打 000。| 其他情况，我可以帮您记录报案。

2.  您好，我想确认下，我没打错电话吧？| 我要报个案子。| 手机查了半天，才找到这个号码。| 希望您能帮上忙。
    _Hello, I just want to make sure_ _if I got the right number_. | _I need to report a crime_. | _I searched forever on my phone_ _for this contact_. | _Really hope_ _you can help me out_.

3.  _Yep, you're in the right place_ _for non-urgent stuff_. | _But if it's like_ _a robbery in progress_, | _we can't handle it here_.
    对，非紧急案件打这儿没错。但要是抢劫正在发生，我们这儿处理不了。

4.  没人受伤。不是啥暴力犯罪，| 可是，损失挺大的。| 我工地的设备没了，急死我了。
    _No one is hurt_. _Not a violent crime_, | _but the loss is bad_. | _My construction site equipment is gone_ – _I'm so worried_.

5.  _Understood. Even a small incident_ _can be upsetting_ _for the person involved_. | _Don't worry, we'll get this documented_.
    明白。再小的事，摊到当事人身上，也让人难受。| 别急，我帮您登记。

6.  保险公司卡着不赔偿我，| 非得先要警方案件编号。| 不然，谁想麻烦警察啊！
    _The insurance company_ _is withholding my compensation_ | _until they get the police case number_. | _Otherwise, who would want to_ _trouble the police_?

7.  _Got it. Sounds like a theft_, | _and your insurer needs proof_. | _Could you walk me through_ _exactly what happened_?
    明白。这听起来像是被盗，| 而且保险公司需要凭证。| 您能给我讲一遍到底发生了什么吗？

8.  我是一个建筑公司的老板。| 昨天晚上，我的一个经理把挖掘机忘在工地上了，| 结果，就被偷了。
    _I run a construction company_. | _Last night, one of my managers_ _left an excavator on the site_, | _and it got stolen_.

9.  _Oh dear, how awful_! | _Is that the big machine_ _that digs the ground of buildings, right_? | _I know that's an expensive machine_.
    天哪，真糟糕！| 就是那种用来挖楼房地基的大型机器吧？| 我知道那机器很贵。

10. 是的。它用来给楼房打地基。| 它非常昂贵。我们给工地上锁了，但它还是被偷了。
    _Yes. It's for digging foundations_ _for buildings_. | _It's very expensive_. _We locked the site_, _but it was still taken_.

11. _This type of equipment_ _is always a prime target_ _for thieves_. | _Even with locks in place_, _they will find a way to break in_.
    这种设备总是盗贼盯上的目标。| 即使上了锁，他们也会千方百计地进去。

12. 可不嘛！幸亏买了保险。| 东西找不回来，至少能拿钱。| 不然，公司的现金流真要崩了。
    _Absolutely! Fortunately_, _we had insurance coverage_. | _Even if the item can't be recovered_, _at least we can get compensation_. | _Otherwise, the company_ _would face a cash flow crisis_.

13. _Absolutely. Now, I'll need a few more details_ _before I can issue you_ _a case number_. | _You need to tell me the model_, _serial number_ _and the exact location_.
    没错。现在我需要再了解一些细节，才能给您一个案件编号。| 你要告诉我机器的型号、序列号和具体位置。

14. 太感谢了！型号和序列号我让项目经理马上发邮件给您。| 一拿到号码，我立马发给保险公司。
    _Huge thanks_! _My project manager will email you_ _the model and serial number immediately_. | _I'll send this_ _to the insurance company_ _the second I get the number_.

    下午好，我是你的物业经理史蒂文。| 您来电反映公寓问题，我给您回电。有什么可以帮您？

2.  你好！感谢这么快回电。我是新租客。| 我的主卧天花板在漏水！
    _Hi! Thanks for calling back so soon_. _I'm a new tenant_. | _My master bedroom ceiling_ _is leaking_!

    _This can't wait_. | _The leak got worse_ _after the storm_, | _and the wall paint_ _is peeling now_!

5.  _Our online system_ _prioritizes urgent cases too_. | _Notifications will come to me_ _straight away_. | _Could you describe_ _the leak location_?
    我们的线上系统也会优先处理紧急情况的。| 通知会直接发到我这边的。| 请描述漏水位置?

6.  就在床的正上方！| 就现在，水滴都直接往被子上滴呢。| 昨晚简直像睡在水帘洞里。
    _Right above the bed_! | _Water is now dripping directly_ _onto the quilt_. | _It felt like I was sleeping_ _under a waterfall last night_.

7.  _That's certainly unacceptable_. | _It must have been_ _disturbing to you_. | _Has there been_ _any roof renovation work done recently_?
    这确实不能忍。| 一定让你很烦吧。| 最近楼顶有施工吗？

8.  不知道。我才搬来五天。这漏水痕迹，明显是陈旧的水渍，都是发黄的。
    _I don't know_. _I just moved in five days ago_. _The water stains_ _are clearly old and yellowed_.

9.  _You're right_. _Water damage can compromise_ _structural safety_. | _I'll dispatch roofers immediately_.
    您说得对。漏水可能危害结构安全。| 我马上派屋顶维修工。

10. 太好了，救了我的命。| 希望他们不用拆天花板。| 我才刚刚布置好卧室啊。
    _Great! That's a lifesaver_. | _Hopefully they won't need to_ _tear down the ceiling_. | _I just finished_ _decorating the bedroom_.

11. _Apologies this wasn't detected_ _during inspection_. | _We'll try to minimize the damage_ _and update you hourly_.
    很抱歉，查房时没发现这问题。| 我们会尽量把损坏降到最小，每小时跟你更新进展。

12. 谢谢。维修需要我清空衣帽间吗？| 我的衣服才刚刚按照颜色整理好啊。
    _Thanks. Should I empty_ _the walk-in closet_? | _I just sorted my clothes_ _by colour_.

13. You just need to _remove bedding_ temporarily. | _Protective covers_ will be used during repairs.
    就暂时移开床上用品就行。| 施工时会铺防护罩的。

14. 好的。那我等你通知。| 希望快点修好，| 别再漏水了。谢谢你。| 下次再报修，我会在网上提交的。
    _Okay. I'll wait to hear from you_. | _Hope the repair gets done soon_ | _and the leaking stops. Thanks_. | _Next time I need to report a repair_, _I'll do it online_.

#70231. Designing a Relaxing Indoor-Outdoor Space - Business

1.  _Hey there! It's been ages_ _since we chatted last_. | _I was just thinking about you_ _the other day_ | _and wondering how things have been going_ _on your end_.
    嗨！咱好久没聊天了。| 我前几天还在想你，| 想着你这边最近怎么样呀。

2.  是啊，好久不见了。我这段时间一直在翻新后院花园。| 现在终于大功告成，花草都种好了。
    _Yeah, it's been a while_. _I've been renovating_ _my backyard garden recently_. | _It's finally done_, _and the plants are all in place_.

3.  _That sounds awesome_! _Your garden redesign_ _looked like a huge project_. | _I hope it all turned out_ _just the way you wanted_.
    听起来太棒了！你重新设计的花园看着真是个大工程。| 希望一切都按你想的那样完成了。

4.  挺顺利的。| 还好，我请的园艺团队很专业，帮我打理得很用心。| 现在，我在挑选户外家具。
    _It went really smoothly_. | _Thankfully, the gardening team I hired_ _was very professional and thorough_. | _Now I'm picking out_ _outdoor furniture_.

5.  _Picking the right plants_ _and ornaments_ _can get overwhelming_. | _There are so many styles_ _and colours to decide on_.
    选合适的植物和装饰品确实很累。| 风格和颜色有太多选择了。

6.  没错，我是先从花园的一角开始的。| 慢慢来，不用赶进度。| 我想让每个部分都很满意。
    _Exactly, I started with_ _one corner of the garden_. | _No rush_ —_taking it slow_. | _I want each section_ _to be just right_.

7.  _Taking it step by step_ _is smart_. | _It gives you room_ _to tweak things_. | _Which corner of the garden_ _are you focused on today_?
    一步一步来很明智。| 能让你有空去调细节。| 今天你在弄花园的哪个角落？

    _Yes, we're planning to add_ _an outdoor sofa_ _and a few lounge chairs_, | _and we're also thinking of_ _adding some waterproof furniture_ _to the deck_.

11. _It's crucial that you'll love it_ _for years to comes_. | _After all, you don't want to_ _redecorate it again too soon_.
    关键是得弄完以后能喜欢很多年，| 毕竟不想没过多久就重装一次。

12. 我会选素净的灰色和棕色。| 然后用彩色抱枕、花盆来增添亮点，| 随时可以调整。
    _I'll pick neutral grey_ _and brown colours_. | _Then I'll add pops of colour_ _with bright throw pillows_ _and flowerpots_. | _Easy to switch up anytime_.

13. _I love that plan_! _Neutral bases_ _with pops of colour_ _are timeless_. | _I'm really looking forward to_ _checking it out_ _when you're done_.
    我喜欢这个方案！素色底配亮色点缀永不过时。| 真期待等你完工后去参观。

14. 我也迫不及待想带你参观啦。| 不过还得等我把灯光和小配饰都摆好，| 大概要过两周。
    _I can't wait to show you around either_. | _But I still need to_ _set up the lighting_ _and small decorations_, | _so it'll probably_ _be another couple of weeks_.

    早上好！最近都不怎么碰到你，| 听说你最近从早到晚都很忙。 你最近还好吗？

    _Thanks for asking_! _Recently, I've been visiting my mother a lot_. | _She's been having leg pain_ _and isn't feeling well_, | _so I've been making time_ _to see her_.

    我记得你说过你妈妈有关节问题。| 来回一趟得好几个小时吧？| 我能想象这对你来说得有多辛苦。

    _Yeah, my mom prefers quiet places_, _so she lives in the suburbs_. | _It's a two-hour drive each way_. _I barely_ _have any free time left_.

5.  _Maybe you could speak with_ _a social worker_. | _They might be able to_ _check on your mother sometimes_. | _They've helped people_ _in similar situations_.
    或许你可以跟社工聊聊，| 说不定他们可以偶尔去看看你妈妈。| 他们以前也帮过跟你情况类似的人。

    我有个朋友去年也领过政府的一些补助。| 你可以试着找同一个部门问问。| 另外，还有社工名录。

    _I've never received_ _any government benefits myself_. | _I'd like to give it a try_. | _The social worker directory_ _sounds really helpful too_.

9.  _It's important to find someone_ _with qualifications_. | _Even if they can't help you directly_, _they'll know who can_.

    _I'd like to ask a social worker_ _to help my mother_ _with a home safety assessment_, | _like installing handrails_ _and non-slip mats_. | _That way_ _she'll be safer in her place_.

13. _Lots of community centers_ _host a weekly free lunch_ _for seniors_. | _Your mother might enjoy the company_.
    许多社区中心每周都会为老年人提供免费午餐。| 你妈妈可能会喜欢有人一起陪伴。

14. 这真是个好主意！我妈妈很喜欢有人陪她一起吃饭。| 我马上联系他们。非常感谢你的帮助！
    _That's a great idea_! _My mother enjoys_ _having someone eat with her_. | _I'll get in touch with them right away_. _Thank you very much for your help_!

#70229. Getting Insured After Moving Out - Business

1.  _Hello! Welcome to our insurance company_. | _I'm here to assist you_ _with anything you need_ _regarding insurance_. _So, what brings you in_?
    你好！欢迎来我们保险公司。| 您的所有保险需求，我都能帮到你。| 那么，您今天是来咨询什么的？

2.  您好，我最近刚开始了第一份工作，| 也正准备搬去我自己的公寓。| 我有一些保险方面的事情想请教您。
    _Hi there. I just started my first job_, | _and I'm also about to_ _move into my own apartment_. | _I've got a few questions about insurance_.

3.  _Of course, I'd be happy to assist_. | _Congrats on both your new job_ _and your apartment_! | _That's quite a few big life changes_ _all at once_.
    当然，很高兴帮你。| 恭喜你找到工作、搬进新公寓。| 这一下子人生变化可真不少啊！

4.  对，是挺大的变化，但我真的很激动。| 我终于可以开始独立生活了，| 不用再住在爸妈那儿了。
    _Yeah, it's a big shift_, _but I'm really excited_. | _I'm finally starting_ _to live on my own_ | _and I don't need to_ _live with my parents anymore_.

5.  _Hope everything goes well for you_. | _So, what would you like to ask_ _about insurance_? | _It's great that you're already thinking ahead_.
    祝你一切顺利。| 那你想了解保险方面的哪些内容？| 你能提前考虑这些，真的很不错。

6.  我知道，我需要给自己的车和个人物品上保险。| 我想了解一下，怎样才能买到性价比最高的那种保险。
    _I know_ _I need to get insurance for my car_ _and my belongings_. | _I'd like to know_ _how to get_ _the most cost-effective insurance_.

7.  _I totally get that_. | _Insurance can be pricey_, | _so it's important to choose_ _the right level of cover_ _so you're not overpaying_.
    我完全理解。| 买保险确实不便宜，| 关键是得买到适合自己的保障，不至于多花钱。

8.  没错。我得想想，哪些东西是必须投保的。| 另外，还有别的方式，能让我每个月要交的保费少一些吗？
    _Exactly. I need to figure out_ _what I should insure_. | _Also, are there any other ways_ _to lower my monthly premium_?

9.  _Paying yearly instead of monthly_ _can save money_. | _But I get that_ _you're just starting out_, | _so it might be difficult_ _to pay a lump sum_.
    如果一次付一年的费用，通常会比按月付款省钱。| 不过，我知道你刚起步，| 所以一次付清可能会有点吃力。

10. 这听起来蛮划算的。| 我手头是有点积蓄的，| 一年付一次，可能其实还更省事了。
    _That sounds like a good deal_. | _I've saved up a bit_, | _so paying annually might actually_ _be easier for me_.

11. _That's right. We do give a discount_ _for annual payments_ | _because it means less time_ _and lower administration costs_. | _It's definitely_ _something to think about_.
    确实是这样。我们对年付用户确实会提供折扣，| 因为那样能节省时间和管理成本。| 确实挺值得考虑的。

12. 我觉得，这对我来说是个正确的选择。| 我父母也担心我会选最低的保险，| 导致没有足够的保障。
    _I think this is the right option for me_. | _My parents are also worried_ _I might go for_ _the lowest coverage_ | _and end up_ _without enough coverage_.

13. _Underinsurance_ _can be a problem_. | _You need to make sure_ _it has enough coverage_. | _If you'd like, I can send you_ _our product information sheet_.
    保额不足确实是个问题。| 你要确保保障够用。| 如果你愿意，我可以把我们的产品说明单发给你。

14. 好的，太感谢你了。这听起来真的很有帮助。| 我回去以后，| 会认真研究一下资料，| 再给你打电话要报价。
    _Sure, thank you so much_. _That sounds really helpful_. | _After I'm home_, _I'll go over the info carefully_ | _and  call you back_ _for a quote_.

7.  _Exactly! It helps newcomers_ _settle in smoothly_. | _We walk you through everything_ _from day one_, | _starting with basic training_.
    没错！这样新人能顺利适应。| 我们从第一天就手把手指导，| 从基础培训开始。

8.  真好。你们有指导手册可以帮我更快融入吗？| 还有，放我进来的保安说，我得有一个员工证。
    _That's great! Do you have a guidebook_ _to help me settle in faster_? | _Also, the security guard who let me in_ _said I need a staff ID card_.

9.  _Yes, you'll need it for building entry_ _and elevator access_. | _We'll take your photo_ _and print the card right away_. | _Then I'll introduce you to your mentor_.
    是的，你得用它进大楼和用电梯。| 我们会马上给你拍照做卡，| 然后我会带您去见您的导师。

10. 还有导师吗？真好！照片的话，| 希望不会太难看，| 我一向不太喜欢拍证件照。
    _And I even have a mentor_? _That's amazing_! _About the photo..._ | _I hope it won't turn out too bad_. | _I've always hated_ _taking ID photos_.

11. _Tell me about it_! _But no stress_, | _we'll take a few_, _and you can pick the one you like best_.
    可不是嘛！不过别紧张，| 我们会多拍几张，你可以挑一张满意的。

12. 听你这么说，| 我就没那么紧张了。| 你们团队的氛围太温暖了，| 我都觉得我已经适应这里了。
    _Now that you say that_, | _I feel less nervous_. | _Your team has such a welcoming vibe_. | _I already feel like I belong here_!

13. _You will find your way before you know it_! | _We hope you'll enjoy your time working here_. | _Every day is different in our company_.
    你很快就能上手了！| 希望你喜欢在这儿工作。| 我们公司的每一天都不一样。

14. 太好了！这正是吸引我入职的原因。| 我知道在这工作不会无聊。| 我都等不及要开始啦。
    _Perfect! That's exactly why I joined_. | _I know it won't be boring working here_. | _I can't wait to start_!

13. No, I don't think so. For _this type of pest_, | it's just _a matter of removal_. | Hopefully, _it won't take too long_.
    我觉得你不用搬的。这种害虫 | 只需清除就行，| 希望不会花太长时间。

14. 好的，那我等你通知了。| 期待你早点告诉我 | 害虫控制公司什么时候来。| 这样我可以安排时间。
    _Alright_, I'll wait for your update. | I'm hoping you can _let me know soon_ | when the pest control company _will come_, | so I can _plan my time_.

#70219. Understanding Bill Payment Delays - Business

1.  Good morning. Thanks for _reaching our bank_. | This is Ryan from the _Customer Service Team_. | _What brings your call_ today?
    早上好，感谢致电我们银行。| 我是客服部的瑞安。| 您今天打电话过来是想咨询什么呢？

2.  早上好。我刚搬到澳大利亚，| 在你们银行开了个户。| 但是，这里的好多事情都让我摸不着头脑。
    Good morning! I've just _moved to Australia_ | and _opened an account_ with your bank, | but I'm _feeling a bit lost_ with how things work here.

3.  Don't worry. _I'd be glad to_ answer any questions about your account. | _Loads of things here_ are probably different from your home country.
    别担心。我很乐意回答您关于账户的任何问题。| 这里的很多事可能都和您原来的国家不一样。

4.  好多事情都跟之前不一样了。| 我正在逐渐适应呢。| 有时候我感觉自己的问题很傻，| 所以都不敢问。
    _Many things are different_ from before. | I'm _gradually getting used to_ it. | Sometimes I feel my questions _are very silly_, | so I _don't dare ask_.

5.  Don't worry. For many questions, our website _has quick answers_. | But you can _ask us directly_ if you still can't find what you need.
    别担心。好多问题，我们网站上都能快速找到答案。| 不过您要是还找不到您要的，直接问我们。

6.  我支付每个月的账单都比较晚。| 我付了钱以后，还是会收到账单方的催款短信。
    I always pay my monthly bills _quite late_. | After I've paid the money, I still receive _payment reminder messages_ from the billing company.

7.  It _probably happens_ because you're paying on the due date. | Some payments _are still pending_. | Payments can take up to 2 days _to go through_.
    估计是因为您踩着截止日付款。| 部分交易还在处理，| 到账最多需要 2 个工作日。

8.  我懂了。意思就是，钱确实从我的账户里划走了，| 但收款人不能马上能收到钱。
    I see. So the money _is definitely deducted_ from my account, | but _the recipient_ won't receive it immediately.

9.  Exactly. Also, _it's good to note_ | that payments _made on weekends or public holidays_ | might _get delayed a bit more_.
    没错。另外，您需要注意的是，| 周末或公共假期的支付 | 可能会多耽搁些时间。

10. 知道这些窍门后，| 办银行业务就能顺手多了。| 我现在开始习惯网上付款啦。
    Now that I know _these tips_, | _handling banking tasks_ could be much easier. | I'm _getting used to_ online payments.

11. Our bank's app _has multiple ways_ to pay.| You can _handle the payments yourself_ easily, | which should _be very handy_ for you.
    我们银行的应用有多种付款方式。| 您自己就可以轻松管理支付，| 这应该对您来说非常方便。

12. 有时我还是很怀念可以去分行，| 跟柜员当面聊一聊，| 尤其是碰上搞不明白的事儿的时候。
    Sometimes I do miss _going to a branch_ | to talk with _a bank clerk_ in person, | especially when I'm _confused about somethingd_.

13. I get that. _Just remember_, | our hotline _is always here_ if you need help or have any questions.
    理解。您只需要记着：| 您需要帮助或有问题时，我们的热线随时为您服务。

14. 非常感谢您的帮助。我现在不那么垂头丧气了。| 如果我还有需要帮忙的地方，| 我一定会再打电话给您。
    Thank you so much for your help. I'm _less frustrated_ now. | If I need _further assistance_, | I'll _definitely call you again_.

#70218. Van Theft Report and Insurance Steps - Legal

1.  Hi there, _you've reached_ the non-urgent police assistance line. | _Constable Brown speaking_. How can I help you today?
    你好，这里是非紧急警务服务热线。| 我是布朗警员。今天我有什么能帮忙的吗？

2.  布朗警官，你好。我想报告一个情况，不确定算不算案件。| 但是我非常着急。
    Hello _Officer Brown_, I want to report something.| I'm not sure if it _counts as a case_. | But I'm _really worried about_ it.

3.  You've _got the right line_ for non-emergency reports. | If it's _urgent_, | you'll need to _hang up_ and dial 000.
    您拨打的是非紧急报案电话。| 如果是紧急情况，| 你需要挂掉电话，然后拨打 000。

4.  不是紧急的，就是我的面包车被偷了。| 是在我昨天工作的地方被偷的。| 不过我人没事。
    It's not an emergency, it's just that _my van was stolen_. | It was stolen from _where I was working_ yesterday. | But I'm _physically fine_.

5.  Discovering something stolen _is always upsetting_. | Even _non-urgent matters_ can be serious. | Let's _go over what happened_ so I can assist you.
    发现东西被偷总是让人心烦。| 就算不算紧急，也可以是很严重的。| 我们过一下事情经过吧，我好帮你处理。

6.  主要是，这车是我干活用的，| 丢了很麻烦。| 保险公司让我先搞个报案单，| 然后才能申请赔付。
    The main thing is that it's _my work vehicle_, | losing it is _a real headache_. | The insurance company wants me to get _a police report_ first, | then I can _file a claim_.

7.  Understood, work vehicles are _crucial_. | So, a van _was taken_? | Sounds like you need _a theft report_ for the insurer. | Tell me where and when you _last saw it_.
    明白了，工作车辆很重要。| 那么，被偷的是一辆面包车？| 听起来你需要给保险公司提供一份盗窃报案单。| 告诉我你最后见到它的地点和时间。

8.  昨天上午，我在建筑工地干活。| 大概中午那会儿，发现我的面包车给人偷了。
    Yesterday morning, while I was working _at the construction site_, | _around noon_, I realized my van was stolen.

9.  Oh no, _that's terrible_! | Vans are _common targets_ for thieves. | Whether the vehicle _is locked or not_, | they know how to _break in quickly_.
    哎呀，这太糟了！| 面包车是小偷的常见目标。| 不管车子有没有锁，| 他们都知道怎么快速弄开。

10. 车我锁好了，| 但没安防盗报警。| 要是有报警器，可能就把贼吓跑了。
    I _locked it up_, | but there was _no anti-theft alarm_. | If there had been an alarm, it might have _scared the thief off_.

11. _Getting an alarm_ is definitely smart. | But those pros _can work so fast_ | that sometimes an alarm _doesn't even slow them down_.
    装报警器当然很明智。| 但那些专业小偷的动作太快，| 以至于有时候报警器甚至都拦不住他们。

12. 这件事就能显出保险的价值了。| 就算我的面包车最终找不回来，| 至少我还能拿到赔偿金。
    _This shows_ the value of insurance. | Even if my van _can't be recovered_ in the end, | I can at least _get the payout_.

13. Please _tell me_ a few more details, | like the location, time, _any witnesses_, | and I'll give you _a report reference number_ for your insurer.
    请多告诉我几个细节，| 比如地点、时间、有无目击者，| 然后我会给您一个报案编号，您可以提供给保险公司。

14. 感谢你。一拿到报案号，| 我就马上联系保险公司。| 这个面包车可是我的血汗钱买的啊！
    Thank you. As soon as I _get the case number_, | I'll contact the insurance company _right away_. | That van was bought with my _hard-earned money_!

#70217. Clarifying Local Dog Leash Rules - Legal

1.  Good afternoon, you have reached _the City Council_. | _How may I help you_ today?
    下午好，这里是市政厅。| 今天有什么可以帮您的？

2.  你好，我想咨询一下这里遛狗的法律法规。| 听说有些邻居看到狗就吓一跳，| 所以我想先搞清楚规矩。
    Hello, I want to ask about the _dog-walking regulations_ here. | I heard some neighbours _get startled_ when they see dogs, | so I'd like to _know the rules first_.

3.  Absolutely! Having a dog means _following rules_. | We've got _straightforward regulations_ to keep everyone safe. | Have you _had a chance_ to check any local regulations?
    当然可以！养狗意味着要守规矩。| 我们有明文规定来保障每个人的安全。| 您有看过本地的相关法规吗？

4.  具体还真的不太清楚。| 我就知道得给狗拴上牵绳，| 但是，像狗狗能不能去海滩这些细节，| 我就懵了。
    I'm _not really sure_ about the details. | I just know I have to _leash my dog_, | but when it _comes to details_ like whether dogs are allowed on the beach, | I'm _completely lost_.

5.  Your dog needs to be leashed _in public spaces_. | However, we have two _designated off-leash parks_ | where they can _roam_. | Also, the _southern section of the beach_ is also leash-free!
    在公共区域必须给狗拴牵绳。| 不过，我们有两个专门的无牵绳公园，| 可以让狗狗自由奔跑。| 海滩的南段也允许放开牵绳。

6.  太棒了。我的狗特别喜欢在水里踩来踩去，| 在沙子里打滚，| 还会追那些海鸥。| 请问有哪些地方是不允许狗狗去的吗？
    That's great. My dog loves _splashing around_ in the water, | _rolling_ in the sand, | and _chasing seagulls_. | Are there any spots where _dogs aren't allowed_?

7.  Indeed, dogs aren't allowed in certain spots like _kids' playgrounds_, | _sports ovals_, and some beaches. | Just look out for the signs before you go in.
    确实，有些地方不允许带狗，比如儿童游乐场、| 运动场以及部分沙滩。| 进去前留意公告牌就行。

8.  了解了。如果我一不留神，没有遵守规定，| 会有什么处罚吗？| 最惨会怎么样呀？
    Understood. If I accidentally _don't follow the rules_, | what penalties might _I face_? | What's the worst that _could happen_?

9.  If you _break the rules_, | like _letting your dog_ off-leash where it's banned, | you might _get fined_. | Fines vary based on _how serious the breach is_.
    如果违反规定，| 比如在禁止区域不牵绳，| 就可能被罚款。| 罚金数额取决于违规的严重程度。

10. 我的狗狗很热情，见人就扑，| 我还真的要多留意。| 还有什么其他遛狗时要注意的吗？
    My dog's so friendly—always _jumps on everyone_ it meets. | I really need to _pay extra attention_. | Any other dog-walking dos and don'ts I need to _look out for_?

11. Absolutely, remember to _pick up after your dog_. | _Leaving dog waste_ means a fine as well. | We've _placed bins_ in most parks.
    没错，记得清理狗狗的排泄物。| 没有清理也意味着被罚款。| 我们在大多数公园里都设有垃圾箱。

12. 我一定会清理狗狗的粪便的。| 谢谢你的解答！| 要不是你提醒，| 我还真没注意这些细节呢。
    I'll definitely _clean up_ after my dog. | Thanks for your _explanation_! | If you hadn't _mentioned_ it, | I _wouldn't have noticed_ those details.

13. Anytime! You can also check the council's website for _off-leash maps_. | If _anything else comes up_, | _swing by our office_ or give us a ring.
    随时乐意效劳。您还可以在市政厅网站上查看不用牵绳区域的地图。| 如果还有其他问题，| 可以来我们办公室或打电话咨询。

14. 太好了，我这就去看一下网站上的地图。| 这周末我就带它去那个海滩的南边。再次感谢你的帮助！
    Great, I'll _check the map on the website_ right away. | I'll _take my dog down to_ the south end of the beach this weekend. | _Thanks again_ for your help!

#70216. Resident Alerts Police to Speeding Driver - Legal

1.  Hi. _You've reached_ the police station. | _Constable Smith speaking_. How may I assist you today?
    你好！这里是警察局，我是史密斯警员。今天有什么能帮你的吗？

2.  您好，我要投诉我们公寓小区里有位司机开车一直超速。| 我们都觉得很危险。| 而且感觉车子发动机很强，非常吵。
    Hi there, I'd like to report a driver in our apartment complex who _keeps speeding_. | We all think _it's really dangerous_. | Also, _the car's engine_ seems really powerful and super loud.

3.  I hear you. People should drive slowly _in an apartment complex_, | especially near kids' play areas or _sidewalks_. | Where and when _did the speeding happen_?
    我理解。大家在公寓小区里开车一定要慢点，| 尤其是在孩子玩的地方或人行道附近。| 超速是在什么地方、什么时候发生的？

4.  其实，我每天送孩子去学校的时候，| 都看到他车子飞速开过去。| 最近的一次发生在今天早上七点半左右，| 就在我们公寓小区门口。
    Actually, every day when I _take my kid to school_, | I see him _speeding past_ in his car. | The most recent time _was around_ 7:30 this morning, | _right at the entrance_ of our apartment complex.

5.  That does _sound risky_. | Do you happen to know _the car's make and model_, | or any other _identifying info_?
    听起来很危险。| 您知道那车是什么牌子、什么型号，| 或者还有其他辨识特征吗？

6.  是辆银色的车。| 车牌号我没看清，| 是我们小区一位年轻人开的。| 表情还非常嚣张呢。
    It's _a silver car_. | I _didn't catch_ the license plate number, | but _it's driven by_ a young person who lives in our complex. | And he always _has this cocky look_ on his face.

7.  Thanks for that. Have you heard if _anyone else has noticed this_, | or if this driver has been _involved in_ any other incidents?
    感谢您的信息。您知道有没有其他人也注意到这事，| 或者这个司机还有没有发生过别的事故？

8.  好多邻居都看到过呢，| 对他都快闻风丧胆了。| 他开车像疯了一样快，| 我们都很担心孩子们的安全。
    _Plenty of our neighbours_ have seen him too | and are almost _scared stiff of him_. | He drives _insanely fast_, | and we're all really worried about _the kids' safety_.

9.  I understand. I'll dispatch _a patrol car_ to monitor the area at those times, | and if we can _pinpoint_ the driver, | we'll _have a word_ with him.
    我明白。我会在那个时段派巡逻警车去监控那个区域，| 如果我们能确认司机身份，| 我们会跟他谈谈的。

10. 谢谢警察同志。我们都希望他能明白这样做的后果，| 不要再超速了。| 我们想看到明显的改善。
    Thank you, _officer. We all hope he can \_understand the consequences_ of what he has done | and can _stop speeding_. | We really want to see _some real improvements_.

11. We'll do everything we can to _address this_. | If you _spot_ anything like this again, | please _let us know_ immediately.
    我们会尽全力处理。| 如果您再发现类似情况，| 请马上向我们报告。

12. 我会盯着他的。| 非常感谢你们的协助。| 我们真不希望每天送孩子的时候都捏一把汗啊！
    I'll _keep an eye on_ him. | Thanks so much _for your help_. | We really don't want to _feel on edge_ every single morning when we're taking our kids to school.

13. No worries. Our _top priority_ is everyone's safety. | Have a great day, and _stay safe out there_.
    不客气。安全是我们的首要任务。| 祝您愉快，注意安全。

14. 谢谢。希望早点抓到那个坏蛋，| 给他点教训。| 如果还有任何情况，| 我会第一时间联系警局。
    Thank you. I hope you can catch that _troublemaker_ soon | and _teach him a lesson_. | If _anything else comes up_, | I will _contact the police_ immediately.

#70215. Inspecting An Off-Market Property - Business

1.  Hi there! _Long time no see_! | I had _no clue_ you are house hunting!
    嘿！好久不见！| 我不知道你在看房呢。

2.  是呀。我们租房子住好多年了，| 我觉得，是时候买下一套属于自己的房子啦。
    Exactly, we've been _renting for years_ | and I feel it's time to _have a place_ of my own.

3.  I _totally get it_. | This area's _super convenient_, | _with the mall and the park_ nearby. | If you moved elsewhere, you'd have to _re-learn everything_ all over again.
    我完全明白。| 这地段多方便啊，| 商场公园都在旁边。| 要是搬到别的地方，你就得重新熟悉一遍周边环境。

4.  可不是嘛，能不动地方最好了。| 我们不想让孩子们又要换学校，| 又要重新适应一遍周围的一切。
    Absolutely, _staying put_ would be ideal. | We don't want the kids to have to _switch schools_ | and _adjust to_ everything all over again.

5.  Exactly. The market is _flooded with listings_ now, | but it might _take a bit_ to find the right one. | _Any luck_ so far?
    确实，市面上现在房源很多，| 但找到合适的可能需要点时间。| 目前你有看中的吗？

6.  我们看了不少房子了，| 有一套房子我们特别中意，但是，价格超标了。| 我们不想让手头太紧。
    We've seen _quite a few properties_. | There's one we really like, but it's _over our budget_. | We don't want to stretch our finances.

7.  That's _a shame_. | But it's smart to _stick to your budget_. | Don't worry, it doesn't mean you won't find _something you love_. | There's _plenty of fish_ in the sea.
    真可惜，| 不过，量入为出是对的。| 别急，这不代表你们找不到喜欢的房子。| 好房子多的是。

8.  我们希望能买一套空房子，| 这样一切都简单。| 我不喜欢到处堆满家具和杂物的房子。| 我觉得我们没办法搬进那样的房子。
    We'd like _an empty property_ | — that _keeps things simple_. | I don't like houses _cluttered with_ furniture and stuff; | I don't think we could _move into one like that_.

9.  You may want to focus on the _floor plan_, | rather than _getting distracted by_ the furnishings. | _Decorations_ can always be changed later.
    或许，你们可以关注房子的户型图，| 而不是被家具干扰。| 房子的装饰到后面都能改的。

10. 有些户型我们就是接受不了。| 我们不想要复式，| 只想要平层。
    Some _layouts_ just won't work for us; | we don't want a _two-story home_ | —we prefer _a single-level place_.

11. It might be worth _checking out_ some of the older homes in the area. | They often match _what you're looking for_. | I can help you _find them_.
    或许可以看看这个区一些年代久一些的房子 | ——它们往往更符合你们的需求。| 我可以帮你找找。

12. 谢谢你。我们不想大改结构。| 最多，微调一两个房间的布局，就可以啦。
    Thank you. We don't want _major renovations_. | At most, we'd just _tweak the layout_ of one or two rooms.

13. Actually, there's one property that _could be perfect_, | but it's _not officially listed_. | I know _the owner personally_, | and can _set up an inspection_.
    其实，有一处房产可能很合适，| 但房子还没挂牌呢。| 我认识屋主，| 可以帮你们安排看房。

14. 太好了。帮我们安排一下吧。| 希望这次能成。| 真希望这套房子能满足我们全家的需求啊。
    Fantastic! Please _help arrange it_ for us. | _Fingers crossed_ this works out! | I really hope this house will meet our _family's needs_.

#70214. Customer Calls About Faulty Washer - Business

1.  Hi there, this is _the appliance shop_ speaking. | My name is Adrian. How can I _assist you_ today?
    你好，这里是电器商店。| 我是艾德利安。今天我能为您做点什么？

2.  你好！我前段时间在你们这里买了一台洗衣机，| 但最近坏掉了，| 总是发出尖锐的噪音，| 吓得我已经一周没用它了。
    Hey there! I bought a washing machine from you guys _a while back_, | but it's _been faulty_ lately. | It always makes _a piercing noise_, | and I've been _too scared_ to use it for a week.

3.  Oh no, sorry to hear that. Do you remember _exactly when_ you bought it? | If it's still _under warranty_, | we might be able to fix it _at no cost_.
    哎呀，听到这些我很抱歉。你还记得具体什么时候买吗？| 如果还在保修期内，| 我们可能可以免费维修。

4.  我是五个月前买的，之前一直运转得挺不错的，| 我原本还挺满意的。结果现在噪音又刺耳，又漏水。
    I bought it five months ago, and it _was working great_. | I was actually _pretty happy_ with it. | But now it's _getting so noisy_ | and it's even _leaking water_.

5.  That should _still be covered_. | Would you prefer _getting it repaired_, | or would you rather we _replace it for you_?
    这应该还在保修范围内。| 你希望我们修理它，| 还是换一台新的给你？

6.  是说我不用出钱修吗？| 我有点搞不清保修是什么意思。| 维修费用是不是都很高啊？
    Does that mean I _don't have to pay_? | I'm _not too sure_ what warranty really means. | Is repair _usually expensive_?

7.  Exactly. Warranty means we'll _cover the repair_ or even replace it for free, | as long as the issue _wasn't caused by misuse_.
    没错。保修就是在一定时间内，只要不是人为损坏，| 维修或更换都是免费的。

8.  太好了。我之前还担心得自己掏钱修。| 那我就放心了。| 我还是想把原机修好。
    Great. I was worried I'd have to _pay out of pocket_. | Then I'm _relieved_. | I'd prefer to _get the original machine fixed_.

9.  Got it. I'll make sure a technician _gets out to you soon_. | Can you tell me when someone can _come by_?
    明白了。我会安排技术员尽快过去。| 您什么时候方便让人上门看看？

10. 这个嘛，我做零售促销兼职，| 周一和周五不上班，| 这两天安排都可以。
    Sure, I work part-time in _retail promotions_, | and _I'm off_ on Mondays and Fridays. | Either of those days _works for me_.

11. That works. One of our technicians will _reach out_ to set up an appointment. | The technician may need to run _a diagnostic cycle_ to identify the fault.
    好的。我们的技师会联系你预约具体时间。| 技师可能需要运行诊断程序来找出故障。

12. 这一套操作下来大概要多久？| 希望能快点修好。| 我在家等着的时候，要准备些什么吗？| 比如螺丝刀？
    How long does _the whole process_ usually take? | I really hope the washer _gets fixed soon_. | When I'm waiting at home, should I _have anything ready_ | —like a _screwdriver_?

13. The _basic check_ usually takes about half an hour, | and if we need to _open it up_ for a motor inspection, | it will _be around_ sixty minutes. | You _don't have to_ get any tools ready.
    整套流程大概半小时，| 如果需要拆机检查电机，| 会大概 60 分钟。| 你不需要准备任何工具。

14. 好。那我在家等他们过来检查吧，| 希望不要是电机的问题。| 谢谢你的耐心服务。
    Alright, I'll wait at home for them _to come check it_. | Hopefully, it's not a problem with _the motor_. | Thanks for _your patience_.

#70213. Strategies for School Band Fundraising - Business

1.  Hey, come on in and _grab a chair_! | My bad for _being swamped_ yesterday! | Now I've _got all the time_ to chat about this.
    嗨，快进来坐吧。| 昨天我太忙了实在不好意思，| 现在我时间很充裕，咱们慢慢聊。

2.  我之前是想跟你讨论，怎么给我们的学校乐队筹集资金，| 让孩子们有更多资金参加音乐巡演。| 你有什么想法吗？
    I wanted to talk with you about how to raise some money for our _school band_, | so the kids can have more funds to _go on music tours_. | Do you _have any ideas_?

3.  Well, I feel like we could totally put together _a fundraiser_. | We just need to _pick the right kind of event_, | like the kind of event people would _jump at attending_.
    嗯，我感觉咱们完全可以搞个筹款活动。| 我们只需要选对活动类型，| 需要大家迫不及待抢着来参加的那种活动。

4.  要不，我们弄一本附近商家的优惠券手册，| 卖给家长和社区居民？| 或者搞些附近商家的东西卖钱，怎么样？
    How about this: we put together _a coupon book with deals_ from the local businesses, | and sell it to parents and _people in the community_? | Or maybe we could sell some products from the local shops to _raise money_?

5.  These are _all great ideas_. | But hey, how about _putting on a concert_ for the school band? | We could use the school's _venue and equipment_, | which would help _keep the costs down_.
    这些都很棒。| 不过哎，你觉得给学校乐队办场音乐会怎么样？| 我们可以用学校的场地和设施，| 这样可以节约开支。

6.  这主意靠谱！| 可以展现孩子们的才艺！| 家长们肯定乐意出钱支持的。| 我们多宣传，| 绝对人气爆棚！
    That's _a solid idea_! | It'd be a great way to _show off the kids' talents_. | I'm sure the parents would be more than happy to _chip in and support_. | If we really _get the word out_, | people _will definitely come_!

7.  I think it's a solid idea too! _Hosting the event_ at school would save us a lot on venue costs. | We could also invite a few _local bands_ to come and perform.
    我也觉得很好！在学校办活动，能省下大笔的场地费。| 我们还可以再请些本地乐队来表演助阵。

8.  我喜欢这个点子！| 还能让音乐会更专业，| 更热闹！| 乐队成员的亲友团绝对会来撑场子的！
    _I love that idea_! | It would make the concert _more professional_ | and _way more exciting_. | The band members' friends and families are definitely gonna _show up to support_!

9.  Yeah, seeing these local bands could really motivate the kids to _rehearse harder_. | Plus, the local bands might _promote the concert_ on their social media too!
    是的，孩子们看到这些本地乐队，会更有动力排练。| 本地乐队也可能会在社交媒体宣传这次音乐会！

10. 太棒了，那就等于免费宣传了！| 我们可以再发动家长们制作蛋糕，甜点 | 和饮料来义卖。
    Awesome, that basically means _free promotion_! | We could also _get the parents_ to make some cakes, desserts, | and drinks to _sell for fundraising_.

11. Genius! That way, _the vibe_ will be way more enjoyable! | It would _make the whole thing_ more fun for everyone!
    妙啊！这样现场气氛更愉快，| 每个人都能待得更开心！

12. 可以！细节方面，咱们得再敲定一下，| 还要联系附近商家，拉拉赞助。
    Sounds good! We'll just need to _finalize the details_ | and reach out to some local businesses _for sponsorship_.

13. Absolutely! Shall we _chat again_ the day after tomorrow? | We'll also need to _apply early for permission_ to use the school venue.
    必须的！后天我们再碰一次怎么样？| 我们也需要早点跟学校申请场地使用的许可。

14. 好的，咱们到时候可以谈谈怎么分头 | 联系家长 | 和商家。| 我这几天先列个待办清单。
    Alright. We can then _figure out_ how to divide things up— | like who'll _talk to the parents_ | and who'll _reach out to_ the local businesses. | I'll put together _a to-do list_ over the next few days.

#70212. Newcomer Navigates Waste Sorting and Gardening - Business

1.  Hi! We haven't had _a proper chat_ since you moved here! | Found _any good spots_ around here?
    你好呀！自从你搬来，我们还没怎么好好聊过呢！| 发现附近有什么好地方了吗？

2.  你好。我暂时只摸清了超市和学校。| 不过，昨天我发现，这里的垃圾分类很不同。| 我正想找人问问呢。
    Hi! So far, I've just _figured out_ the supermarket and the school. | But yesterday I noticed _the waste sorting system_ here is quite different. | I was just _wanting to ask someone_ about it.

3.  Ah! The _Aussie bin system_! | That _confuses everyone_ at first. | Tell me what's _puzzling_ you?
    啊！澳洲的垃圾桶系统啊！| 刚开始确实让人糊涂。| 跟我说说你哪里不明白呀？

4.  比如，为什么有三个不同颜色的垃圾桶？| 还有哪些垃圾要单独处理吗？
    Like, why are there _three different colored bins_? | And what waste needs _separate handling_?

5.  Well, _the red lid_ is for general waste, | the yellow one is for _recycling_, | and the green one is for _organics_. | Some items, like batteries, need _special drop-off_. | Most supermarkets _take them_.
    嗯，红色盖子装普通垃圾，| 黄色回收，| 绿色有机垃圾。| 像电池这种特殊物品要单独处理。| 多数超市都有回收点。

6.  哦，所以，电池要单独处理呀。| 那么，旧的电子设备，我该扔到哪里呀？
    Oh, so _batteries_ need separate handling. | Where should I _dispose_ of old electronic devices then?

7.  The City Council holds an _e-waste collection day_ quarterly. | _The next one_ will be in October, | at the _community centre_.
    市政厅会每个季度办电子垃圾回收日，| 下次在十月，| 地点在社区中心。

8.  了解了。我还想种菜，| 我需要买几个高架菜床、| 一根浇水软管，| 还有其他园艺工具。| 你知道在哪里买吗？
    Got it. I also want to _grow some vegetables_. | I need to get a few _raised garden beds_, | a _watering hose_, | and some other _gardening tools_. | Do you know _where to buy_ them?

9.  I'd say, the gardening centre _along the highway_ is your best bet. | It's quite big, and usually has _a wider range of stuff_.
    我觉得公路那边的园艺中心是你最好的选择。| 那地方挺大的，通常种类也更多。

10. 太好了。我搬家的时候啥园艺工具都没带过来。| 运费实在太贵了。| 所以现在我得重新添置一批。
    Great. I _didn't bring_ any gardening tools with me when I moved here. | The _shipping costs_ are too high. | So now _I've got to_ buy everything again.

11. I see. Picking out new tools can actually _be pretty fun_. | Plus, that place _isn't too pricey_, | which is _a bonus_.
    我明白。其实挑新的工具也挺有意思的。| 而且那家店的价格不太贵，| 这算是个额外的好处。

12. 太好了。我已经迫不及待想种点东西了，| 就是这边的环境 | 跟我的祖国那边差很多。
    Great. I really _can't wait to_ plant something, | it's just that the _environment_ here | is so _different from back home_.

13. _How about_ I come with you to the gardening centre now? | We can pick plants that _grow well_ in our soil.
    要不我现在陪你去园艺中心？| 我们可以选些适合本地土壤的植物。

14. 那太好了！我正担心选错植物呢。| 我们走吧，我开车，你可以坐副驾，给我指指路呀！
    That'd be wonderful! I was just _worried about_ choosing the wrong plants. | Let's go. I'll drive, and you can _sit up front_ and guide me.

    你好！我是狗狗训练中心的首席训犬师。| 我同事说你刚领养了一只可爱的小公狗。| 我能帮你些什么？

2.  你好。是的，我刚领养了一只小狗。| 听说你们的小狗训练课程口碑很好，| 我想多了解一下。

    That sounds great! The puppy we adopted is _super cute_. | He is _intuitive_, | but he is also _quite naughty_. | I'd love to _get him started with_ the course as soon as possible.

5.  That's _a smart move_! | Puppies are _adorable_, | and it's simpler _to nip unwanted habits_ in the bud. | Our _next session_ starts in just a few days.
    这个想法非常明智！| 小狗都很可爱，| 早点纠正坏习惯也会更容易。| 我们下期课几天后就开始了。

6.  那时间正好合适。| 我的孩子们经常跟小狗一起玩，| 所以我还想让孩子们一起参加，| 让他们也学学。
    That's _perfect timing_! | My kids play with the puppy _all the time_, | so _I'd love for_ them to join too | —that way they can learn together.

7.  Absolutely! The class will teach your kids how to _handle the puppy_, | especially how to keep him _under control_ during walks.
    当然可以。课程会教你的孩子们控犬技巧，| 特别是遛狗时怎么控制小狗。

8.  太好啦！我的孩子们一个十岁，一个八岁，希望他们可以学习怎么照顾小狗，| 比如，怎么遛狗，怎么给小狗护理毛发，怎么科学喂养。
    That's amazing! My kids are ten and eight, and I hope they could learn how to _take care of_ the puppy, | you know, stuff like walking him, _grooming him_, and feeding him properly.

9.  Well, our course is _a perfect fit_ then! | The course also includes _socialization training_. | We'll teach your pup _how to interact with_ people and other animals.
    嗯，那我们的课程就正合适啦。| 我们的课程还包社交训练，| 会教你家小狗怎么跟人和其他动物相处。

10. 太好啦。课程的价格是多少？| 课程会包含小狗笼养训练和上厕所训练吗？
    That's great! How much does the course cost? And does it include crate training and potty training for the puppy?

11. _Rest assured_, the course covers everything! | You're _in good hands_! | It's 200 dollars for six weeks. By the way, is your pup _up to date_ on all his shots?
    放心吧，课程内容全包的。| 交给我们绝对靠谱的。| 课程价格是六周 200 澳币。对了，你的小狗疫苗打全了吗？

12. 课程价格挺合理的。| 下一期课我们能参加吗？小狗的疫苗都打过了。兽医给我疫苗证明了。
    The price _sounds very reasonable_. | Can we _join_ the next session? | The puppy's _got all his shots_. | _The vet_ gave me his vaccination certificate.

13. Perfect! Let's get the little guy _signed up now_. | Don't forget _his shot records_ when you attend the first lesson!
    太棒啦！咱们现在就给小家伙报名吧。| 第一堂课别忘了带好所有疫苗证明哟！

14. 太好啦。放心，我会带着的。希望能培养出一只听话不捣蛋的小狗！
    Perfect! No worries, I'll bring them. Hope we can raise _a well-behaved_, non-mischievous puppy!

1.  Hey, long time no see! How are things _shaping up_ with your new business?
    嘿，好久不见！你的新生意做得怎么样？

2.  你好呀！刚开始的几个月，真的挺辛苦的，| 不过，好在生意现在开始红火了，| 跟之前比，现在我忙多了。
    Hey! The first few months _were really tough_, | but gladly business _is getting busy_ now. | Compared to before, I'm _way busier_ these days!

3.  That's great news. _I've been told_ the previous owner of this building | left _a ton of junk_ here when they left.
    太好了。我听说这栋楼上一个房主搬走时，| 在这留下了一堆垃圾。

4.  确实，真让人头疼啊。| 我这阵子全心投入到生意里了，| 都没来得及顾这事呢。
    Yeah, it's _such a headache_. | I've been so _wrapped up_ in the business | that I haven't had a chance to _deal with it_.

5.  Actually, I could _lend a hand_. | You probably saw that I got _a skip bin_ delivered here last month.
    实际上，我可以帮你一把。| 你可能看到了上个月我这送来一个大型垃圾箱。

6.  那么大的垃圾箱，我当然看到啦！| 你是打算用它清理仓库垃圾吗？你的垃圾肯定不少啊！
    Of course I saw that _huge skip bin_! | You're using it to _clean out the warehouse_, right? You must have a ton of junk!

7.  _Funny enough_, I don't. It turned out much bigger than I thought. | It's _only half full_ at the moment. | Do you need to use it _for your trash_?
    搞笑的是，我其实没多少垃圾。这箱子比我想象的大多了，| 现在才装了半箱。| 你要用这箱子扔你的垃圾吗？

8.  求之不得！谢谢你！我怀疑前一个业主压根没处理过垃圾，| 我能轻松就能把垃圾箱装满。
    Perfect! Thank you! I doubt the previous owner _never cleared the junk_. | I could _easily fill_ this skip bin!

9.  Perfect! _Make use of it_! | It'd _be a shame_ to let it sit empty. | Hiring it _costs a lot_!
    太好了！赶紧用起来！| 空着不用太浪费了。租这东西可不便宜啊！

10. 我知道租大垃圾箱有多贵，特别是租一周的话。| 你要我帮你分担一下费用吗？| 或者我可以给你的车提供一次保养，来感谢你给我用垃圾箱，| 这帮我省掉了大麻烦。
    I know how expensive it is _to hire_ a skip bin, especially for a whole week. | Want me to _chip in_? | Or I could _give your car a service_ as a thank you! | — you just saved me _a ton of hassle_!

11. I'd really appreciate _your generous offer_! | Fantastic! My car _is due for_ a service anyway, so that's perfect.
    感谢你这么大方！太好了！| 我车本来也该保养了，这下正好。

#70209. Birthday Book Dilemma - Business

1.  Hi there! I recall seeing you _a few days back_ | when you picked up that actor's _biography_.
    嗨！我记得几天前见过你，| 那时候你买了那位演员的传记。

2.  你好！我本来想把这本书当作朋友的生日礼物，| 可她已经买过同一本了，因为她是那位演员的头号粉丝。
    Hi! I was going to give this book _as a birthday gift_ to my friend, | but she already has bought one herself because she's _a huge fan of that actor_.

3.  Oh dear, that's _unfortunate_. Since she's such a fan, | it really _would have made_ an ideal present.
    天哪，那太不巧了。既然她是粉丝，| 这本书本来可以是件完美的礼物啊。

4.  没错，这主意原本很棒的。当时，这本书很快就脱销了，| 但我还是设法买到了一本。
    Yes, it was a great idea. At that time, the book _sold out fast_, | but I _managed to_ get a copy.

5.  I'm certain your friend will appreciate _the effort and thought_ you made | _picking out a gift_ for her, | despite how things _turned out_.
    我相信你朋友肯定能感受到你给她 | 挑礼物时花的心思和努力啦，| 不管结果如何。

6.  是啊，她还是收到了一些不错的礼物的，| 所以也不是很有关系的。| 不过我现在有点不知道该怎么办，我自己是不想要这本书的。
    Right, she did get some _nice presents_, | so it's _no big deal_. | But I'm kind of _unsure what to do now_. I don't want to keep this book myself.

7.  If you don't want this one, you could _swap it for_ something different. | Are there any other books your friend _might enjoy_?
    如果你不想要这一本，你可以换成别的。| 你朋友或许还喜欢什么别的书吗？

8.  我只知道她喜欢那本人物传记。| 至于她还爱看什么其他书，我还真的不知道。| 与其说绞尽脑汁也可能送不到她心仪的礼物，| 不如我请她去吃个广式早茶。
    I _just know she likes_ that biography. | As for what other books she _loves to read_, I honestly don't know. | Rather than _racking my brains_ and possibly still failing to give her a gift she truly loves, | I might as well take her out for _dim sum_.

9.  That's a lovely idea as well. So, I can _process a refund_ for you on this book.
    这主意也不错。那么我可以帮你把这本书退掉。

10. 谢谢你。我真没想到这本书她已经有了，| 看来办理退款是最合适的解决办法了。
    Thank you. I really _didn't expect_ she already had this book. | _Getting a refund_ seems like the best solution.

11. _Alternatively_, you could choose a different book for yourself. | If nothing else _grabs your interest_, just return here for a refund.
    或者你也可以挑一本别的书给自己。| 如果没找到喜欢的，随时回来柜台给你退款。

12. 好的。我还有一个小时才得回去上班，| 所以我有时间慢慢挑。| 你能在这么棒的店工作，真让人羡慕呀！
    Alright. I still have an hour before I _go back to work_, | so I have time to _browse slowly_. | I _envy you_ for working in such a great store!

13. Thanks. I _adore my job_. | I'm _passionate about_ books | and _guiding people_ to find books they'll enjoy. | It's a perfect job for me.
    谢谢。我很喜欢我的工作。我热爱书，| 也爱帮人挑到喜欢的书。| 这工作对我来说太合适了。

14. 我能感觉到你的热情！| 你真是位超级棒的店员呀。| 你们这里的服务也确实很棒。
    I can feel your _passion_! | You really are an amazing _staff member_. | The _service here_ is truly great.

#70208. Resolving Off-Plan Apartment Concerns - Business

1.  Morning, thanks for _ringing in_. What can I do for you today?
    早上好，感谢致电。我今天能为您做些什么？

2.  您好，我在网上看到你们的网站，| 对地产方面有些疑问，想请您帮忙。
    Hi, I _came across_ your website online | and _have a few questions_ about property. I'd appreciate your help.

3.  Absolutely, we specialize in _property law_, | and will do everything we can to _sort out_ your issue.
    当然可以，地产法是我们的专长，| 我们会尽全力帮您解决问题的。

4.  谢谢。我买了个公寓楼花，| 定金已经付了，可是现在我遇到大麻烦。| 我很焦虑，不知道怎么处理。
    Thank you. I purchased an _off-the-plan apartment_ | and paid the _deposit_, | but _a serious issue_ has come up. | I'm _really anxious_ and don't know what to do.

5.  I totally understand. Buying _real estate_ is a big investment, | and even when things _go smoothly_, | the process itself can be quite stressful.
    我完全理解。买房是一笔大投资，| 就算一切顺利，| 过程本身也非常让人紧张。

6.  确实啊，事情不太顺利。| 昨天我刚和卖家签了合同。| 但是，我之后又发现了一些问题。
    It's really _not going well_. | I _exchanged contracts_ with the seller just yesterday, | but I _believe there are_ some problems.

7.  Could you _clarify_ the issues? | Is it about the building itself, or maybe _pet-related_? | We'll check the contract and _resolve them_ for you.
    您能具体说明是什么问题吗？| 是关于房屋本身的问题，还是宠物相关的问题？| 我们会查阅合同内容，为您解决问题。

8.  其实都不是。那些都没问题。| 我刚发现隔壁批准了一座新的公寓楼，| 从它那边正好能直接看到我的后院，| 这让我太不喜欢了。
    Actually, neither. Those are _all fine_. | I just found out they approved a new apartment building _right next door_ | that'll _have a straight view_ into my backyard. | I really don't like this at all.

9.  I understand. Since you _signed only yesterday_, | you could _invoke_ the cooling-off period clause | to _get your deposit back_.
    我明白了。既然您是昨天才签的合同，| 你可以利用合同中的冷静期条款，把定金拿回来。

10. 您能帮帮我吗？这几年我为了买房，节衣缩食地存钱，| 我承担不起这笔定金损失啊。
    Can you please help me? I've been _saving every penny_ for years to buy this property. | I _can't afford_ to lose this deposit!

11. Certainly! I'd be glad to help. We can _schedule an appointment_ to review the contract together. | Is there _anything else_ you'd like to discuss?
    当然可以！乐意效劳。我们可以约个时间一起看看合同。| 您还有其他想聊的吗？

12. 我们明天见面，您有空吗？我会带着所有的文件的。谢谢您，| 真希望能尽快得到帮助。
    Would you be available to meet tomorrow? I'll _bring all the documents_ with me. Thank you. | I really hope to _get your help_ as soon as possible.

13. Sure. _How does 2 pm tomorrow_ work for you? | We can _go over your options_ then.
    没问题。您看明天下午 2 点方便吗？| 到时候我们可以详细讨论您可选的方案。

14. 太好了！我的人生又有希望了！| 这个时间很合适。谢谢您！明天见！
    That's fantastic! My life _has hope again_! | This time _works perfectly_. Thank you! See you tomorrow!

    Thank you, I know _your coffee shop_ is the busiest in the morning. | I _won't hold you up_ for too long.

3.  That's right. _Most of our trade_ happens in the morning. | Afternoons are _pretty quiet_. | Folks around here tend to _clock in and out early_.
    是啊，我们大部分的生意都集中在上午，| 下午就很冷清。| 这附近的人上下班都挺早的。

4.  我知道你的顾客大多是建筑工人和技工，| 我觉得他们会喜欢我的产品的。你需要多少，我都能供货。
    I know most of your customers are construction workers and _tradespeople_, | and I think they'll love my products. _You name the quantity_, and I can supply it.

5.  I'm always _on the lookout_ for new offerings. | I make my own _sandwiches and salads_, | but I _also source from_ suppliers like you.
    我总是对新产品很感兴趣。| 我自己做三明治和沙拉，| 但也会从像您这样的供应商那里拿货。

6.  我很乐意每天给你送来新鲜的产品。| 我会根据你的热销产品，来调整供应的。
    I'm happy to deliver _fresh products_ daily. | I can adjust my supply based on _what sells best_.

7.  That's amazing! You never know which product will _be the hit_. | I'd love to hear more about _what you offer_.
    太好了！你永远不知道哪款会成为热销品。| 我很想多了解一下你的产品。

8.  我擅长烘焙，| 尤其是蛋糕和饼干。| 这些食谱都是我祖母传下来的。
    I specialize in _baking_, | especially _cakes and cookies_ | —my recipes _come straight from_ my grandmother.

9.  I see. You bake _old-fashioned treats_ | that _spark_ childhood nostalgia. I think they'll be a hit.
    我明白了。你做的是那种能唤起童年记忆的传统点心。| 我觉得它们肯定很受欢迎。

10. 是的，很多人都很喜欢我的食谱。| 我已经把业务拓展了，有了更大的店铺，| 生意还在不断增长。
    Yes, lots of people love _my recipes_. | I've _expanded my business_ and got a bigger shop, | and business _keeps growing_.

12. 当然可以，没问题的。我会带上产品目录和批发价表。| 周四您方便吗？
    Sure thing. No problem. I'll bring my _product catalogue_ and wholesale price list. | Is Thursday _good for you_?

13. Thursday works great. My business partner will be here too, and we _can decide then_.
    星期四很合适。我的生意合伙人那天也会在，我们那时候可以做决定。

14. 太好了。我很期待见到你的合伙人。谢谢你给我这个机会，周四见！
    Great. I look forward to meeting your partner. _Thanks for the opportunity_—see you on Thursday!

#70206. Easy Ways to Pick Up Our Kids - Education

1.  Hi! It's good to see you! Come on in! _Everyone's here already_.
    嗨，很高兴见到你！进来吧——大家都到了。

2.  你好，不好意思我迟到了，你今天组织了这么盛大的活动呀。
    Hi, sorry I'm late. You've organized _such a grand event_ today.

3.  Thank you! It's _been a long time_ since we last met. | I've been thinking of _arranging_ an afternoon tea. | I hope _nothing bad happened_ to make you late?
    谢谢！我们很久没见了。| 我一直想安排一次下午茶。| 希望你不是遇到什么麻烦才迟到的？

4.  不是，完全不是。我下午计划去学校接孩子放学，所以我走路去，又走路回来的。
    No, not at all. I _planned to pick up_ my kid from school this afternoon. So I walked there and back.

5.  Sounds like _a great adventure_! | I've _never tried walking there_ before. | It must have taken you a long time to _get there and back_, right?
    听起来像一次大冒险！| 我从来没走过。| 你来回一定要很久吧？

6.  嗯，比我预期的要久，但路并不难走。| 我从公园穿过去，| 没有沿着主路走。
    Yeah, it took longer than I expected, but _the route_ wasn't difficult. | I _cut through the park_ | instead of _taking the main road_.

7.  I wish I could _walk with my kids_ like that. | But I've _been swamped lately_. | Even driving to pick them up _is tough_.
    我真希望能这样和孩子们一起走着上学。| 但最近我太忙了，| 连开车去接他们都难。

8.  我打算经常这样做。如果你愿意，| 这几天我可以帮你接孩子。| 下午我不上班，对我来说很方便。| 你就不用专门跑一趟学校了。
    I plan to do this _regularly_. If you like, | I can pick up your child for you _over the next few days_. | I'm _off work_ in the afternoons, so it's easy for me. | You wouldn't have to _make a special trip_ to the school.

9.  Wow, that would be _a huge help_! | I'm sure my kids _would enjoy walking_! | It's _good exercise_ for them. | As long as you _don't mind_, of course. | I hope it's _not a bother_.
    哇，这真帮大忙了。| 我肯定孩子们会喜欢走路！| 对他们锻炼身体也好。| 当然，只要你不介意就好，| 我不想给你添麻烦。

10. 没问题。我在之前的学校，| 和另外三个家长组了个小组，| 轮流拼车接孩子。| 现在趁大家都在，| 我们还可以问问其他家长是否愿意加入。
    No problem. At my kid's _previous school_, | three other parents and I formed _a carpool group_ | _taking turns_ to pick up the kids. | _While everyone is here_ now, | we could ask other parents if they'd _like to join_.

11. I think that's _a wonderful idea_! | I already know a few parents here who'd _be interested in_ joining.
    我觉得这是个很棒的主意! | 我已经知道这里有几位家长会有兴趣加入的。

12. 好的，我们需要组织一下，这样每个人都能清楚安排。| 但我不太清楚该怎么开始。
    Okay, we need to _organize this_ so everyone knows the schedule. | But I'm _not quite sure_ how to get started.

13. We need to _first find out_ who's interested | and _set up a group chat_ on social media to organize these things.
    我们需要先看看谁有兴趣，| 然后在社交媒体上建个群聊来组织这些事。

14. 太棒了，建群很简单，这样每个人就能清楚具体的安排了。
    Perfect. Setting up a group is easy. Then everyone will know _the exact plan_.

#70205. Fixing a Faulty Laptop Under Warranty - Business

1.  Hi there! Thanks for _stopping by_ our computer shop. What can I do for you today?
    你好，欢迎光临我们的电脑店。请问今天有什么我能帮忙的吗？

2.  你好，我今天不是来买东西的。我的笔记本电脑出了点毛病。
    Hi, I'm _not here to buy_ anything today. My laptop's having some issues.

3.  That's totally fine. We offer _diagnostics and repair services_ here. | I'll _definitely see_ what I can do for you.
    没问题，我们这边有提供检查和维修服务。| 我肯定可以帮你看看。

4.  我把笔记本带过来了，是在你们店买的，可是它最近总是出问题，| 搞得我很头大。
    I brought my laptop with me. I bought it from your store, but lately it _keeps having problems_. | It's really _frustrating_.

5.  Got it. Good thing you _brought it in_. | Did you happen to bring the receipt and _the warranty card_?
    明白了，您带过来就对了。| 您带发票和保修卡了吗？

6.  有的，小票我带了，| 电脑也还在质保期。| 这台电脑，我买到现在还不到一年呢。
    Yeah, I brought the _receipt_. | It's still _under warranty_. | I bought this computer _less than a year ago_.

7.  I see. Since it's still under warranty, it _really shouldn't_ be having problems this early. | It's _a solid model_.
    了解，既然还在保修期，按理说不该这么快出问题。这款型号的电脑不错的。

8.  刚买的时候都还好，我很满意的。| 但是用了两三个星期之后，它就开始发烫了，| 我不得不关机。它还会开始随意自动关机。
    It _worked fine_ at first, and I was very happy with it. | But after 2-3 weeks, it started _getting too hot_, | so I had to turn it off. It even began _shutting down by itself_ randomly.

9.  Yeah, laptops _do get warm_, | depending on what you're doing, and your _room temperature_, | but they _shouldn't be overheating_.
    明白。笔记本在使用过程中会发热，| 跟工作内容和室温有关，| 但不该这么烫的。

10. 我用这个电脑处理商务文件的。| 无论什么资料，处理的时候都会丢失。| 这事搞得我很烦，| 我也不知道是哪出了问题。
    I use this computer for _business documents_. | Every time I _work on files_ with it, they get lost. | This is _driving me crazy_, | and I _can't figure out_ what's wrong.

11. Oh, no! It might be _a busted fan_, | a battery issue, or something _on the software side_. | I'll _have to take a look_ to know for sure.
    哎呀！可能是风扇坏了，| 可能是电池问题，也可能是软件方面的故障。| 我得检查一下才能确定。

12. 那我是不是得把电脑放在这？| 我已经把文件都备份好了，| 我就是怕修电脑的时候资料会丢。
    So I need to _leave the laptop here_, right? | I've _backed up_ everything already | —I'm just worried _something might get lost_ during the repair.

    嗨，感谢你这么早就到了。| 我想和你一起过一下我们最新的数据情况。

2.  没问题！我喜欢早点开始。| 我之前就希望我们这周能找个时间，深入聊聊这个事。
    No problem! I like to _start early_. | I was thinking we could schedule some time this week to really _dig into this_.

3.  We're now _serving over twice_ the number of people compared to two years ago, | and I'm honestly worried about _keeping up_.
    我们现在帮助的人数是两年前的两倍多，| 说实话我有点担心我们能不能应付得来。

4.  确实，以前主要是老人和家庭，| 但现在越来越多年轻人也需要我们。
    It's true — while we've traditionally served _seniors and families_, | more young people are _coming to us_ now.

5.  I guess many folks are struggling to _cover basic groceries_ these days. | Prices have really _climbed_.
    我猜现在很多人都难以负担基本食材。| 物价确实涨得厉害。

6.  要是需求这么高下去，| 求助的人还是这么多，咱们的库存马上就耗光了，| 我不知道我们该怎么做。
    If the demand _keeps surging_ like this | and we keep getting _so many requests_, | we'll _burn through_ our inventory soon. | I don't know _how to handle this_.

    咱们得想办法多提高公众的食物捐赠。| 我相信你肯定有好点子。

    We could start a social media _donation campaign_ | and _get news coverage_ to spread the word. | Let's ask people to donate more money and food to stock up our _food bank_.

    要是能让本地电视台报道一下，| 说不定还能上新闻呢，那就帮大忙了！

10. 好主意！借助新闻扩大影响力，| 能覆盖到比我们直接接触还更广泛的人群。
    Good idea! _Using news_ to expand influence | can _cover a wider crowd_ than we could reach directly.

11. We could also _add a page_ to our website | explaining that volunteers _run the pantry_, | so more funds _go directly to_ food.
    咱们还可以在官网上加个页面，| 说明食品库是志愿者运营的，| 这样更多钱就能直接买食物了。

12. 我们还可以在网站放上一些我们的照片，| 比如志愿者工作照，| 让人看到大家热心做事的样子。| 在这儿工作的人也会乐意一直帮助我们。
    We could also _post some photos_ on our website | —like _volunteers in action_ | —_to show people_ how passionate everyone is. | The folks working here would be happy to _keep helping out_ too!

13. Love that! I really appreciate all you have done! None of this happens _without your effort_.
    太棒了！我非常感激你所有的付出。要不是你，咱们这儿根本做不起来。

14. 收到感谢真的很有成就感！| 希望捐赠可以源源不断，| 这样我们就能帮到更多有需要的人啦。
    It's _so rewarding_ to be appreciated! | Hopefully, the donations will _keep coming_ | so we can support more people _in need_.

2.  下午好，我这边有件事想请教，但不知道该怎么开口说起。
    Good afternoon. I've got an issue _I need help with_, but I'm not sure how to get started.

3.  That's fine. I can _explain your options_ | and _refer you to_ a lawyer who can take your case if you need one.
    没问题——我可以给您提供一些信息，| 如果需要，我也能帮您推荐一位律师。

4.  能告诉我推荐的律师是谁吗？这样可能也不错。| 不过我想先了解一下推荐费是多少。
    Could you tell me _the lawyer's name_? That sounds not bad | —but first, I'd like to know how much _a referral costs_.

5.  Actually, we're _a government service_. | Our _legal information_ and referrals are free. | You won't _owe us a cent_ unless you _engage a lawyer_.
    事实上，我们是政府部门，| 提供免费法律信息和推荐服务。| 只有您真的聘请律师，才会产生费用。

6.  哦，明白了。我现在也不确定需不需要律师，希望能免去这步，| 我实在不想上法庭。
    Oh, got it. I'm not sure I need a lawyer—I really hope I can _avoid this_. | I really don't want to _go to court_.

7.  It's _a wise idea_ to avoid going to court if possible. | Why don't you tell me about _the details of your problem_, and let's start from there?
    避免上法庭确实是个明智的想法。| 您不如先跟我说说您的具体问题，我们从那儿开始？

8.  我和邻居在围栏问题上有分歧。| 他坚持让我出新围栏一半的费用，但我不同意。
    I have _a dispute_ with my neighbour over our fence. | He _insists_ I pay half the cost of a new fence, but I refuse.

9.  Could you explain why? It seems you have _solid grounds_ for not wanting to split that cost.
    能说说原因吗？听起来您有充足的理由不想分摊这笔费用。

10. 邻居家孩子整整几个小时对着围栏踢球，| 把围栏踢到严重损坏。| 我让他们停下，可他们根本不理。
    Their kids have been _kicking a ball_ against the fence for hours, | leaving it _badly damaged_. | I told them to stop, but they _ignored me_.

11. There's _a standard process_ for these disputes. | If they damaged _the shared fence_, | they're _on the hook for_ the full cost of the new fence.
    通常解决这类纠纷有固定流程：| 如果是他们造成的共有围栏损坏，| 就得由他们承担新栅栏的全部费用。

12. 噢！我没意识到这一点！| 这听起来很有希望啊。| 不过如果他们不配合，该怎么办呢？
    Oh—I _didn't realize_ that! | That sounds _promising_. | But what if they _refuse to cooperate_?

13. The _simplest route_ is to have a friendly chat with your neighbour | and try to _reach an agreement_.
    最简单的做法是先跟邻居好好沟通，| 看看能不能尽量达成一致。

14. 好，我会这样办的。希望能顺利解决，有需要我会再来电的。谢谢你！
    All right—I'll do that. Hopefully it _goes smoothly_; if not, I'll call back. Thank you!

4.  是的，我一般会在本地集市摆摊卖画，| 不过销售情况时好时坏。
    Yes. I usually _set up a stall_ at the local market to sell my work, | but my sales are _quite inconsistent_.

5.  Got it. Have you tried selling your work through _galleries_? | It's _an approach_ many artists take.
    明白了。您尝试过在画廊销售吗？| 许多艺术家都会这样做。

6.  这一点我其实也想到过。我有联系过几家画廊的。| 但是，他们抽的佣金实在太高了，| 就会导致我的利润很少。
    I've actually thought about that before. I've _reached out to_ a few galleries, | but their _commission rates_ are so high | and it leaves me with _barely any profit_.

7.  I totally get that. Gallery commissions are _no joke_. | They can _be really steep_. | Have you ever thought about _selling your work online_? | Online sales are _booming_ right now.
    我完全能理解。画廊抽成可不是闹着玩的，| 能贵到离谱。| 您有没有想过把销售转到网上呢？| 现在网上销售也很火。

8.  网上销售？我听说过，但是我没什么这方面的经验。| 您是指通过专门的平台或者网站吗？
    Online sales? I've heard about it. But I _don't have much experience_ with that. | Do you mean _specific platforms_ or websites?

9.  Well, you might want to _begin by_ using social media platforms | to connect with _a broader audience_. | Plus, your buyers can _get full transparency_ on what they're purchasing.
    嗯，您或许可以先从社交媒体平台入手，| 来接触更广泛的受众。| 另外，你的买家也能非常透明地看到他们买的是什么。

10. 这个建议太棒了。在线上，客户能全方位看到我的作品，| 肯定更吸引人。| 我家里的油画和素描现在都堆成山了，| 根本没地方放了。
    This advice is amazing! When clients can _get the full perspective_ of my work online, | that would _be more appealing_. | My _oil paintings_ and sketches are just piling up at home now | with _nowhere to go_.

11. You can also _engage directly with potential buyers_ with the help of social media. | Also, you can _post updates_ whenever you want | and _showcase_ new work on a regular basis.
    社交媒体还能让您直接跟潜在买家互动。| 而且，您可以随时发布更新 | 和经常展示新作品。

    That sounds amazing. Posting on social media isn't actually _that complicated_ for me, | but I guess it'll take some time to _build a following_ and get engagement.

13. I believe _you'll nail it_! | Also, if you want to _plan an exhibition_ | or special event _down the line_, | you can promote it _via social channels_ too.
    我相信你能做到的！| 而且，以后如果您想办个展览 | 或特别活动，| 你也能用社媒渠道来宣传。

    Thank you for _your kind words_. | You've given me a lot of _practical ideas_ and confidence today. | This _has really helped_ me a lot!

    确实不需要支付任何费用。| 我们会免费提供一栋很大的靠近海滩的房子，| 可以同时容纳两个家庭。

8.  那真是太好了！我儿子特别喜欢海滩。| 但是我们家有四口人，| 如果能安排两间房间，就再合适不过了。
    That's really great! My son _especially loves_ beaches. | But there are _four of us_ in the family, | having two bedrooms would be _just perfect_.

9.  Every family _is assigned_ two bedrooms | along with its own _private bathroom_. | We also supply food _for shared cooking and dining_, | which gives you the chance to _connect with new people_.
    每个家庭都会配备两间卧室 | 和独立的浴室。| 我们还会提供食材，让大家可以一起做饭和就餐，| 这样你们有机会认识新朋友。

10. 太好了。这样的话，我们就有机会认识其他的家庭了！| 我儿子也能认识一些能理解他的情况 | 和一起分享相似经历的朋友。
    That's great. That way, we will _have the opportunity_ to connect with other families, | and my son can _make friends_ with those who understand his situation | and share _similar experiences_.

11. He can make new friends _so sure_, | and you'll also get support from _fellow parents_. | Would you like to _proceed with_ the application now?
    他一定会交到新朋友，| 您也能从其他家长那里获得支持。| 您现在要办理申请吗？

12. 要的，非常感谢。我已经好久没有和家人一起度假了，| 希望这个申请过程不要太繁琐，| 让我们可以轻松享受这次假期。
    Yes, thank you very much. I haven't _taken a family vacation_ for a long time, | and I hope _this application process_ won't be too complicated | so that we can _easily enjoy_ the holiday.

13. It _won't be at all_. It's very simple, | with just a single form _to fill out_. | Once you complete it, we'll contact you to _schedule your holiday date_.
    一点也不复杂的。非常简单。| 只需要填写一张表格。| 您一填完表，我们就联系您确定度假日期。

14. 非常感谢您的帮助。我真的很期待这次假期，| 我儿子也肯定会非常兴奋的。| 也感谢您组织了这么棒的项目。

    I know there will be _extra fees_ | —hopefully _not too expensive_. | I don't have _a firm leave date_ yet; | I need to discuss it with my _new employer_, | who said I could take time off _by year's end_.

11. It depends on your _fare class_, | but fees are usually _modest_. | You'll _get refunded the balance_ after cancellation. | You probably need to _act soon_ | and _read the terms_ of your ticket carefully. | Some discounted tickets _aren't changeable_.
    这要看您的票种，| 不过一般手续费不高。| 取消后差额会退还。| 您可能得尽快操作，| 并仔细阅读机票的条款。有些特价票不能更改。

    Oh my god. I _really can't believe_ someone would do something like this. | Even though I don't have any _highly valuable items_ at home, | _replacing these things_ is still a hassle.

11. If your home and belongings _are insured_, | your insurance should _help cover the cost_ of replacing the stolen items. | Also, could you check if _anything else is missing_?
    如果您的房屋和物品都有保险，| 保险应该可以帮您赔偿更换被盗的物品。| 另外，您能再确认一下是否还有别的东西被偷了吗？

12. 对对对，我竟然忘了我还有保险！| 保险肯定能帮上忙。| 要是可以的话，我想等警察来了以后，我再详细检查整个房子。
    Oh right! I _can't believe_ I forgot about my insurance! | It _definitely should_ help. | If possible, I'd prefer to _check the entire house_ carefully after the police arrive.

13. Definitely, it's a smart idea to wait inside your car until _the police show up_ | so _nothing gets disturbed_. It won't take much time.
    当然，最好是在车里等到警察到达，| 这样可以确保不破坏现场。时间不会太久的。

14. 非常感谢你们帮忙。回家看到这种情况，真是我最不想遇到的。| 你们的帮助实在是救了我一命啊。
    Thank you so much for your help. This is _the last thing I ever wanted_ to see when I got home, | your assistance has truly been _a lifesaver_.

#70196. Pharmacist Advice for Flu-Like Symptoms - Medical

1.  Hi, you seem _a bit under the weather_. What can I do for you?
    嗨，你看上去好像身体不太舒服。有什么我能帮忙的吗？

2.  是呀。我很难受。| 我女儿大概从一周前就开始咳嗽了，| 现在我也咳嗽起来了，我感觉我好像也感染了同一种病毒。
    Yes, I _feel unwell_. | About a week ago, my daughter _started coughing_, | and now I'm coughing too. I feel like I've _caught the same virus_.

3.  Oh dear, there's _quite a potent virus_ circulating these days, | and many people have already been _hit by it_.
    哎呀，最近有一种很厉害的病毒在传播，| 已经影响到很多人了。

4.  医生说我女儿不用吃药，| 只要呆在家休息，不去上学就行。| 她现在已经恢复了，不过我病得比她严重，| 感觉特别难受。
    The doctor said my daughter _doesn't need any medication_ | and should _just stay home_ instead of going to school. | She's recovered now, but I'm _much sicker_ than her | and feel really _awful_.

5.  Well, kids usually _bounce back from_ viral infections more quickly than adults. | I'm sorry you've _caught it_ too. It's quite unfortunate. | This virus can be _quite contagious_.
    孩子通常比大人更快从病毒感染中恢复。| 很遗憾你也感染了。太不幸了。| 这个病毒传染性很强。

6.  没错，这病毒的传染性实在是太强了。| 你能不能帮我开点药，| 让我感觉好一点呢？
    Yeah, this virus is _so contagious_. | Could you _prescribe_ some medication | to help me feel _a bit better_?

7.  Unfortunately, no medicine can _cure a viral infection outright_. | The virus usually has to _run its course_ | while your body _heals on its own_, which can take a while.
    遗憾的是，没有任何药物能直接治愈病毒感染。| 通常病毒需要 | 靠你身体自己恢复，这可能得花一段时间。

8.  我感觉是实在太糟了，全身酸痛，| 就连躺在床上也觉得疼。| 而且，我还发烧了。
    I feel really terrible; my whole body _aches_ | and even _lying in bed_ is painful. | I also _have a fever_.

9.  I understand. _Although I can't directly_ prescribe medicine here, | I can definitely recommend some _over-the-counter options_ | that may help _lower your fever_ | and let you _sleep better_.
    我明白。虽然我不能直接给你开药，| 但我完全可以推荐一些非处方药，| 它们可能可以帮你退烧，| 让你睡得更好些。

10. 太好了，发烧真是太难熬了。| 一开始我觉得特别冷，| 接着出了好多汗，| 热得要命。| 而且我的喉咙也很痛。| 刀割一样疼。
    That's great, having a fever _is really awful_. | At first, I felt _really cold_, | and then I _broke out in a heavy sweat_. | It was _unbearably hot_. | Plus, _my throat is hurting_ so badly, | it feels like it's being _sliced with a knife_.

11. You might try some _throat lozenges_ | that might ease your _sore throat_. | You could also try some _steam inhalation_, | which can help _soothe your cough_.
    你可以试试含点含片，| 可能会缓解你的喉咙痛。| 你也可以试试吸蒸汽，| 有助于缓解咳嗽。

12. 好的，我试试。非常感谢你。| 我真希望我能快点好，我不能一直待在家里，耽误上班了。
    Alright, I'll _give that a try_. Thanks a lot. | I really hope I can _get better soon_. | I can't keep staying home and _missing work_.

13. Yes, while the medicine won't _tackle_ the virus itself, | it should definitely _help with the symptoms_. | I hope you feel better soon and can _get back to work_.
    是的，虽然药物不能直接治好病毒，| 但肯定能缓解你的症状。| 希望你快点好起来，能回去上班。

14. 非常感谢你的帮助。生病真是太麻烦了，| 总让人觉得特别难受，| 我真心希望能尽快恢复正常。
    Thank you so much for your help. _Being sick_ is such a hassle. | It always makes you _feel terrible_. | I truly hope to _get back to normal_ as soon as possible.

    早上好。感谢你今天抽空来办公室和我见面。

2.  早上好啊。没事的。能见到你和团队的其他人，我很开心。
    Good morning. It's okay. I'm really glad to see you and _the other members_ of the team.

3.  That's good to know. I'd like to have a quick chat with you about how your _work-from-home_ setup is coming along. How are things going so far?
    那挺好的。我想跟你简单聊聊你在家办公的安排情况。目前都还好吗？

4.  目前都挺好的。虽然我很想念你们，但是不用每天跑办公室上班，| 真的是帮我省了不少的通勤时间啊！
    So far, so good. Although I _really miss you all_, | not having to _rush over to the office_ every day | has really saved me a lot of _commuting time_!

5.  Well, we miss _having you around_ as well, | but it's great to know you're _enjoying working from home_. | I understand how much _it matters to you_.
    嗯，我们也很想念跟你一起工作。| 不过，了解到你喜欢居家办公真是太好了。| 我理解这对你来说很重要。

6.  是呀。不用再花两个小时在通勤上，| 真的给我带来了很大的变化。| 我现在感觉精力充沛了不少。
    Yes, _not having to_ spend two hours commuting | has _made a huge difference_. | I feel much more _energetic_ now.

7.  That's _wonderful to hear_. | But I've _been informed by_ the IT Department | that you've _encountered_ some technical problems recently.
    真是太好了。不过，信息技术部跟我说 | 你最近遇到了一些技术问题。

8.  是呀，我家里的网络状况不是很好，| 尤其是在高峰时段，| 网速很慢，有时甚至会崩溃。
    Yes, _my internet connection_ isn't very good, | especially _during peak hours_: | it gets really slow and sometimes it _even crashes_.

9.  I noticed that you _get disconnected_ from online meetings occasionally, | though I wasn't aware that it was due to _technical glitches_.
    我注意到线上会议时你偶尔会掉线，| 但我不知道这是技术故障造成的。

10. 唉。我试过把路由器放到家里的每一个角落，| 但是都没有用。技术人员建议更换一台新设备，| 还要升级到更快的套餐。
    Ah, I've tried _placing the router_ in every corner of the house, | but nothing worked. The technician suggested replacing it with _a new device_ | and upgrading to _a faster plan_.

11. I see. We'll _arrange to get you_ a new network device | and _switch you over to_ a higher-level plan.
    我了解了。我们会给你更换一台新的网络设备，| 并且帮你升级到一个更高级的套餐。

12. 好的。我都开始担心这些问题会影响我的工作效率和工作量了，| 技术故障真是让人头疼啊！
    Okay. I'm starting to worry that these issues will affect my _work efficiency_ and workload; | technical glitches are _such a headache_!

13. Don't worry. I'll talk with _the appropriate team_, | and once we have the _go-ahead_, I'll let you know. | You're also welcome to _reach out to them directly_ to get it resolved.
    别担心。我会跟相关团队沟通，| 一批下来就通知你。| 你也可以直接联系他们解决。

14. 太好了。我真的非常感激你帮我解决这个问题。| 我希望能尽快恢复到正常的工作状态。
    That's great. I truly appreciate your help _in resolving this issue_. | I hope to _get back to normal work_ as soon as possible.

#70194. Phone Inquiry about Electric Bike Rules - Legal+Business

1.  Hi, _you've reached_ the police station. | Are you c*alling about* an emergency | or do you need to _report something_ non-urgent?
    你好，这里是警局。| 您是因为紧急情况来电，| 还是有非紧急事件需要报案呢？

2.  你好，我没有紧急情况。| 我有点犹豫，不知道如果我不是来报案的，| 打个电话咨询一下是不是可以？
    Hello, I _don't have an emergency_. | I'm _a bit hesitant_ about whether it's okay | to call just to ask a question when I'm _not reporting an incident_.

3.  _Don't worry about calling_. During emergencies, | we might _be tied up_, | but it's _quiet at the moment_. I'm here to help.
    电话咨询没问题。如果碰到紧急情况，| 我们可能忙不过来。| 不过，现在不忙。我很乐意帮忙。

4.  谢谢你。我儿子让我给他买一辆电动自行车。| 这样，他去朋友家就更方便了。| 但是，我不太放心。
    Thank you. My son asked me to buy him _an electric bike_ | so that it is more convenient for him to _go to his friend's place_. | But I'm _a bit worried_.

5.  Well, electric bikes have become very popular _among teenagers_, | and parents love them as well, | ince they no longer have to _drive their kids around_.
    嗯，电动自行车很受青少年欢迎，| 家长也很喜欢，| 因为这样他们就不用开车接送孩子了。

6.  对，我愿意给儿子买。| 但是，我对电动自行车的道路规定有些疑问。| 我试着在网上查了查，| 但是我感觉那些信息不是特别清楚。
    Yes, I _am willing to_ buy one for my son. | But I have some questions about _the road rules_ for electric bikes. | I tried _checking online_, | but I felt that the information was _not very clear_.

7.  Electric bikes follow the same _general road rules_ as push bikes, | but there are also a few special rules _just for them_.
    电动自行车和普通自行车一样，都适用一般的道路规则。| 不过它们也有一些专门的规定。

8.  原来是这样。我不太清楚，我儿子骑电动自行车的话，| 是不是要像骑摩托车那样，需要考驾照。
    I see. I'm not sure if my son needs to get a driver license to _ride an electric bike_, | just like _riding a motorcycle_.

9.  No, he _doesn't need one_. | Even though both vehicles _have motors_, | they're _categorized differently_. | Electric bikes don't need _a license or insurance_.
    不，不需要。| 虽然这两种车都有电机，| 但是它们的类别不同。| 电动自行车不需要驾照或保险。

10. 我明白了，这样确实能简单点儿。| 不过，我在给儿子买电动自行车之前，还得考虑很多问题，| 毕竟，市面上电动自行车的选择实在太多了。
    I see. That definitely makes things _a bit simpler_. | However, there are still _many factors to consider_ before buying him an electric bike. After all, there are _so many options out there_.

11. _Absolutely_, there are plenty of options. | I believe _a dealer_ can really offer you | _some solid advice_ on picking the right electric bike.
    确实，选择非常多。| 我觉得，经销商能给你一些 | 挑选合适电动车的有用建议。

12. 有道理。我会确保我儿子熟悉电动自行车的道路规则的。| 我也会买一辆符合规定的车给他。
    That makes sense. I will make sure my son _is familiar with_ the road rules for electric bikes. | I will also buy him a bike that _meets the rules_.

13. Great, that's _good to know_. | You can always check _the government transportation website_ for all the road safety rules. | I hope your son _has fun riding_ | and _stays safe_.
    听到这个我很高兴。你可以在政府交通网站上查到所有道路安全规定。| 希望你儿子骑得开心，| 也能注意安全。

14. 太感谢了。警察同志，你真的是帮了我大忙。| 我非常感激你的耐心解答。| 这次通话解决了我的很多疑问。
    Thank you so much. Officer, you have _really helped me a lot_. | I really appreciate _how patiently_ you answered my questions. | This call _has resolved_ many of my questions.

#70193. Talking Through a Retirement Plan - Business

1.  Morning! Thanks a lot _for calling in_. What can I help you with today?
    早上好，谢谢你打电话来。我今天能帮你点什么？

2.  你好呀，我想聊聊我的退休计划，| 可以吗？我最近一直在考虑这个问题。
    Hey there! I was hoping to talk about _my retirement plan_ | —if that's okay? It's just something _that's been on my mind_ lately.

3.  Of course! That's _exactly what I do_. | I _help people with_ retirement planning. | It's _super important_ to have enough saved up | so you can _live comfortably_ once you stop working.
    当然可以啦，我专门做这个的。| 我帮大家做退休规划。| 存够钱很重要，| 这样退休后才能过得舒舒服服的。

4.  对，我想管理好开支，| 退休以后能有更多时间去做现在没空做的事。
    Yeah, I want to _keep my expenses under control_ | and have more time in retirement to do the things I don't really _get to do right now_.

5.  Yeah, totally. _The earlier you plan_, the better. | Plus, it's better to _keep checking in_ on your plan, | because your situation and needs _are always changing_.
    没错，越早开始规划越好。| 而且，最好时不时检查一下计划，| 因为你的情况和需求一直会变。

6.  我以前确实没太考虑这些事。| 不过，现在离退休不远了。| 我觉得要重新整理一下了。
    I _hadn't really thought_ about this before. | But as I get closer to _retirement age_, | I think it's time to _revisit my plan_.

7.  Absolutely. This isn't something you just _set up once_ and forget about. | But I'll _make it easier_ for you. So: where do you want to start?
    当然了，这不是那种一次搞定就能不管的事。| 不过我会帮您把过程简化。那您想先从哪块儿说起？

8.  我不知道自己到底该存多少钱。| 我看新闻和媒体都有讲这方面的事，| 我挺担心自己的积蓄不够用。
    I'm _not really sure_ how much money I need to save. | I see news and media _talking about this_, | and I'm pretty worried my savings _won't cut it_.

9.  That's _a common concern_ that many people share. | I hear folks _throw out some figures_ all the time. | But honestly, it all depends on _your own goals_. | What you need might _be totally different from_ someone else.
    是啊，很多人都会担心这件事。| 我经常听到有人随口提一些数字。| 但说实话，这完全取决于你自己的目标 | ——每个人的需求可能完全不同。

10. 说得有道理。我得先搞清楚我想过什么样的退休生活， | 才能对症下药地规划。
    That makes sense. I need to _figure out_ what kind of retirement life I really want | so I can _plan accordingly_.

11. Exactly. Once you've _got a clear picture_ of what you need, | I can help you figure out how to _get there_ step by step.
    完全正确。一旦你搞清楚了自己需要什么，| 我就能一步步帮你规划达成目标的方案。

12. 我挺开心能终于开始动手整理我的退休理财了。| 毕竟，我已经有一段时间没管这个问题了。
    I'm really glad I'm finally doing something about my _retirement finances_. | After all, I've _been ignoring it_ for a while.

13. That's _a solid first step_. | I can also send you _a few forms_ to help you think through | what things you'll need to _take into account_ when planning.
    这是很棒的第一步。我还可以发你一些表格，| 帮你理清在做计划时要考虑的点。

14. 好的。最好能在我下一次预约之前，把表格发过来。| 我想先看看内容，再决定怎么继续，| 这样会比较安心。多谢你。
    Sounds good. It would be great if you could _send those forms over_ before I book the next session. | I'd feel more comfortable _looking things over first_ | before I decide how to _move forward_. Thanks a lot.

1.  Hey there, welcome to _the council hall_! | What _brings you here_ today?
    你好，欢迎来到市政厅！| 今天有什么能帮您的？

2.  下午好！我来是想问问我正在策划的一个社区活动。
    Good afternoon, I'd like to ask about the community event I'm _organizing_.

3.  Of course! Can you give me more details _about the event_? | _How do you think_ the city council can help?
    没问题！可以多给我讲讲这个活动吗？| 你觉得市政厅能怎么帮你？

4.  是这样的，我发现最近有一些新移民搬到这里，| 我想通过组织一个活动，向他们介绍澳大利亚的文化。
    Well, _I've noticed_ that some new migrants have moved in recently, | so I'd like to organize an event to _showcase_ Australian culture.

5.  Wow! We're always happy to welcome new migrants _from different parts of the world_ | who _have settled in_ this area. | I think this is _a fantastic idea_.
    哇！我们一直很欢迎来自世界各地的新移民 | 搬到这个社区定居。| 我觉得这个想法真的太棒了。

6.  谢谢你！我想咨询一下，能不能租下社区大厅一周？| 我打算办一个小型的澳大利亚电影节。
    Thank you! I'd like to know if I can _hire the community hall_ for a week. | I'm planning to hold a small Australian _film festival_.

7.  You can rent the community hall for _an entire week_, | but it will _depend on_ the schedule | and whether _the space is available_.
    您可以租用社区大厅一整周，| 但这取决于时间安排 | 和场地是否空闲。

8.  我了解了。我计划六个月以后举办电影节。| 为了拿到批准，| 我可真是费了不少工夫啊。
    I got it. I'm planning to _hold the film festival_ in six months. | _Getting the approval_ for it | really took me _quite a lot of effort_.

9.  I'm sure _putting this event together_ takes a lot of effort, | but it sounds fantastic. I believe many people _will love it_.
    筹备这个活动肯定需要不少工夫。| 但听起来真的很棒。我相信会有很多人喜欢的。

10. 只要场地确定下来，| 我就可以开始在本地做宣传了。| 我希望能吸引更多人来参加。
    Once the venue _is confirmed_, | I can _start promoting_ it locally. | I hope to _attract more people_ to join.

11. The council might be able to _assist with_ promotion. | Our _local engagement team_ can help with that. | This is _a wonderful event_.
    可能市政厅可以帮你宣传。我们的本地推广团队可以帮忙。| 这个活动很棒。

12. 太感谢了！我真的希望活动能办得成功。| 市政厅的宣传支持对我来说帮助很大，| 能吸引更多人来参与。
    Thank you so much! I really hope the event _will be a success_. | The council's support in promotion is _a big help_ to me, | and it will attract more people _to participate_.

13. How about _coming over to meet_ the events team? | They'll _be available_ tomorrow, | so you can _finalize the venue_ | and _go over_ the advertising details.
    要不要过来见见活动团队？| 他们明天有空，| 你可以确认场地，| 并商量宣传的细节。

14. 太棒了！我明天整天都有空，那就明天见咯！| 谢谢你的帮助，期待和团队见面！
    That's great! I'm _free all day tomorrow_, so I'll see you then! | Thanks for your help, and I'm _looking forward to_ meeting the team!

#70191. Navigating Customer Service Challenges - Business

1.  Hi, great to see you! Come on in and _have a seat_. | I wanted to check: how's _the new job treating you_?
    嗨，见到你真高兴！快进来坐吧。| 我想问问，你的新工作怎么样？

2.  很好，谢谢！最近工作挺忙的，| 不过我喜欢这种忙碌的感觉，| 这样上班时间会过得特别快。
    It's going really well, thanks! Work's been _pretty hectic_ lately, | but I enjoy _staying busy_. | It really makes the workday _fly by_.

3.  Yeah, I get that. I had a chat with _your supervisor_, | and he mentioned that you're doing great and _picking things up really fast_.
    是啊，我理解。我和你的主管聊过，| 他说你表现得很棒，学东西也特别快。

4.  我很高兴他对我的工作满意。| 毕竟我已经干了几个星期了，| 现在感觉越来越有自信了。
    I'm really glad to hear that he's _happy with my work_. | After all, _I've been here_ for a few weeks now, | so I'm _starting to feel_ more confident.

5.  The more you _interact with customers_, | the more confident _you'll get_. | Providing good customer service _is key_.
    接触的顾客越多，| 你的信心就会越足。| 高质量的客户服务很重要。

6.  确实。我很喜欢跟顾客交流，| 帮他们找到最好的解决方案。| 但说实话，这并不简单。
    Absolutely. I really enjoy _talking to customers_ | and _figuring out the best way_ to help them. | But honestly, it's _not always easy_.

7.  So true. Even if a business _has a great system in place_, | issues still _pop up_. | And _when they do_, | customers tend to _get even more frustrated_. | Have you _run into_ any tough situations?
    没错。就算生意的运营流程很好，| 还是会出现问题。| 一旦有问题，| 顾客往往会更不高兴。| 你遇到过难处理的情况吗？

8.  是的。有人把本该打折的商品 | 按原价卖给了顾客。| 那位女士回家后才发现，| 她非常郁闷。
    Yeah. Someone _charged a customer_ full price | for something that was _supposed to be discounted_. | The customer _didn't realize it_ until she got home, | and she was _really upset_.

9.  Oh no! I can totally see why she'd _be mad_: | it must've been _such a hassle_ for her. | I hope you were able to _sort it out_.
    哎呀！我完全能理解她为什么生气，| 这对她来说肯定很麻烦。| 希望你已经把问题解决了。

10. 是的，我纠正了这个错误，退还了差价。| 但她还是很生气，我真不知道还能怎么做。
    Yeah, I fixed the mistake and _refunded the price difference_. | But she was _still pretty upset_, and I wasn't sure what else I could do.

11. _In situations_ like that, | you could offer her _a discount voucher_ for her next purchase. | _Just be sure_ to check with your supervisor first.
    遇到这种情况，| 你可以给她一张下次购物的折扣券。| 不过要先跟你主管确认一下。

12. 哦！我明白了。如果当时我给她折扣券，| 她可能就有不一样的反应了。| 我知道她是我们的常客。
    Oh! I see. If I had given her a discount voucher _at the time_, | she might have _reacted differently_. | I know she's _a regular customer_.

13. Exactly! Keeping _returning customers_ happy is super important. | _The last thing_ we want is a bad review online.
    没错！让回头客满意真的太重要了。| 我们最不想看到的就是网上的差评。

14. 明白了。要是没处理好，| 可能会影响不好。| 我很高兴我现在知道该怎么给客户多多提供帮助了。
    Got it. If things _aren't handled well_, | they could have _a negative impact_. | I'm really glad I now know how to _go the extra mile for_ customers.

#70190. From Crib to Platform Bed - Social+Business

1.  Hey! It's so nice to see you again. It _feels like forever_ | since we _last caught up_. How have you been?
    嗨！再见到你真好。感觉我们很久没聊天了，| 你最近怎么样？

2.  是啊，好一阵子没见了。| 这段时间我一直忙着装修家里，| 现在终于搞定了。| 总算可以好好享受新家的感觉了！
    Yeah, _it's been a while_! | I've _been caught up with_ renovating my home | and now it's _finally done_. | I can finally _enjoy my new home_!

3.  That's awesome! I remember when you showed me your _renovation plans_. | It felt like _a huge project_. | Did everything _go as planned_?
    太棒了！我记得你之前给我看过装修计划，| 感觉是个大工程。| 一切顺利吗？

4.  是的，整体来说都挺顺利的。| 幸运的是，我们找到了一家很靠谱的建筑公司，| 大工程已经完成了。| 现在我们正忙着做最后的装饰，| 让家更有个性。
    Yeah, overall, everything _went pretty smoothly_. | Luckily, we found _a great contractor_, | and _the big work_ is done. | Now we're just _focusing on decorating_ | and adding some _personal touches_.

5.  Totally! Decorating the entire house must _be exhausting_, | especially with _so many decisions to make_. | It can _be overwhelming_!
    完全同意！给整个房子做装饰肯定是件大工程，| 特别是要选那么多东西，| 会很有压力。

6.  我们每次只装饰一个房间，| 这样不会太赶。| 反正也不赶时间，| 这样还能慢慢挑喜欢的东西，| 不会买了又后悔。
    We're _taking it one room_ at a time, | so it doesn't feel too _overwhelming_. | There's _no rush anyway_, | and this way, we can _carefully pick things_ we really love | instead of making _impulsive choices_.

7.  That's _a great approach_! | _Taking your time_ means you can really make sure | everything turns out _just the way you want_. | What room are you _working on_ at the moment?
    这种方式很棒！| 慢慢来才能装出自己 | 真正喜欢的感觉。| 你现在在弄哪个房间？

8.  我现在在装饰我女儿的房间。她马上要从婴儿床换成大的平台床了。| 她成长得实在是太快了！| 感觉昨天她还在学走路呢！
    I'm _decorating_ my daughter's room right now. | She's about to move from _her crib_ to a bigger platform bed | —it's crazy _how fast she's growing_! | Feels like just yesterday she _was learning to walk_!

9.  Switching to _a platform bed_ is an important milestone! | There are so many great _bed options_, | and some even come with _built-in storage_.
    换平台床可是个重要的里程碑呀。| 现在很多床都不错，| 有些还带储物功能。

10. 对啊，这太方便了！儿童房的储物真的很重要，所以我想买一个能用很多年的床，最好是她能一直睡到青少年时期的。
    Yeah, that would be so convenient! Storage is a huge deal in a kid's room, so I want to get her a bed that'll last for years, hopefully even into her teenage years.

11. That's a smart choice. You don't want to redecorate too soon, so getting something that lasts makes a lot of sense.
    这个想法很明智，没人想这么快又重新装修，买个耐用的确实更划算。

12. 我们也这么想。所以，我们喜欢简单素净的设计，然后用小地毯这种容易换的小东西来增加一些鲜艳的色彩。
    We feel the same way. That's why we go for simple and neutral designs and add some bright colors with easy-to-swap items like rugs.

13. That sounds perfect! I can't wait to see how your place turns out when everything's done. I bet it's going to look fantastic!
    听起来很棒！我特别期待看看你家装好的样子。我觉得肯定会超级好看！

14. 我也很期待让你过来看看！不过估计还得花点时间。慢慢装饰才能让家更有感觉，我不想匆匆忙忙地搞定它。
    I'm looking forward to having you over too! But it'll probably take a little more time. Taking it slow makes a home feel more inviting—I don't want to rush it.

    下午好！请进，坐吧。我同事说你对我们的志愿者项目感兴趣。

2.  下午好！是的，我刚搬到这个社区一个月，想了解怎么更好地融入这里，多认识一些朋友。
    Good afternoon! Yes, I just moved to this neighbourhood a month ago, and I'd love to find ways to get more involved and make new friends.

3.  We're always in need of more volunteers. None of our community projects would be possible without the volunteers who dedicate their time.
    我们这边总是需要更多志愿者。如果没有这些热心奉献的志愿者，我们的社区项目根本无法实现。

4.  我在家工作，所以时间比较灵活。每周我能抽出几个小时做志愿者，而且也希望能认识更多人。
    I work from home, so my schedule is pretty flexible. I can spare a few hours each week for volunteering, and I'd love to meet more people.

5.  Many of our volunteers end up becoming good friends. Do you have any specific interests? We can try to match you with a project that suits you.
    我们很多志愿者最后都成了好朋友。你对什么特别感兴趣吗？我们可以帮你找到一个适合你的项目。

6.  我其实什么都愿意做，但我特别喜欢园艺和种植。我家里正在弄个小菜园。
    I'm open to anything, but I really enjoy gardening and planting. I'm actually working on a small vegetable garden at home.

7.  That's perfect! We have a project that would be a great fit for you. We're fixing up the park near the shopping center.
    太棒了！我们正好有个非常适合你的项目——修缮购物中心附近的公园。

8.  其实我前几天也注意到了，公园里的灌木丛确实需要修剪，杂草也长得到处都是，整个地方看起来不太美观。
    I actually noticed that a few days ago. The bushes definitely need trimming, and the weeds are everywhere. The park doesn't look great right now.

9.  We need people with some gardening experience who can help clean up the space. Everything is overgrown and needs a lot of trimming.
    我们需要有园艺经验的人帮忙整理公园。现在那里杂草丛生，需要好好修剪一下。

10. 我会修剪树枝，也懂一点园艺。公园如果整理好了，肯定会变得很漂亮。而且，它还能给社区添上一块舒适的绿色空间。
    I have experience trimming branches and know a bit about gardening. Once the park is cleaned up, it'll definitely look beautiful. Plus, it'll give the community a nice green space to enjoy.

11. There's quite a bit of work to do, but I believe the park will look amazing once it's done. We're also planning to install new benches to make it more inviting.
    这项工作量不小，但等公园整理好后，肯定会焕然一新。而且，我们还计划安装新的长椅，让公园更有吸引力。

12. 公园对整个社区来说真的很重要。人们需要一个可以散步的地方，或者只是坐下来放松一下，享受新鲜空气。
    Parks are really important for the whole community. People need a space where they can take a walk or just sit down and relax in the fresh air.

13. Yes, and we're lucky to have raised enough donations to restore it. Everyone is looking forward to the reopening.
    是啊，而且我们已经筹集到了足够的捐款来修缮公园，大家都在期待它重新开放。

14. 我很高兴能参与这个项目，帮助改善公园的环境。这不仅能让公园更漂亮，还能让整个社区变得更适合居住。
    I'm really happy to be a part of the project and help improve the park. It's not just about making it look nicer—it'll also make the whole neighbourhood a better place to live.

#70188. A Low-score University Assignment - Education

1.  Good afternoon! Come in and take a seat please. I received your email saying you wanted to meet me.
    下午好！请进，请坐。我收到了你发的邮件，说你想跟我见面。

2.  您好。是的。谢谢您抽时间见我。
    Hello. Yes, thank you for taking the time to see me.

3.  That's totally fine. I try to leave some free time available each day for students. I hope your studies are going well.
    没关系。我每天都会尽量给学生留出些空余时间。希望你学习进展顺利。

4.  事实上，我对我第一篇论文的分数不是很满意。我不理解您为什么会给我这么低的分数。
    In fact, I'm not very satisfied with the grade I received for my first paper. I don't understand why you gave me such a low score.

5.  Oh, right. I wanted to have a talk with you about that, but I just haven't had the chance.
    哦，对。我本来就想和你谈谈这件事，只是一直没机会。

6.  我明白。希望您可以给我一些反馈。距离下一节课还有一小时，希望时间足够。
    I understand. I hope you can give me some feedback. There's still an hour until the next class, so I hope we have enough time.

7.  The reason your paper isn't as good as it could be is the structure of your essay. Your ideas are fine, but the paper lacks a clear logical flow.
    你论文成绩不理想的原因在于文章的结构。你的观点没问题，但论文缺乏清晰的逻辑性。

8.  哦。我的论文里确实有几个部分是最后几分钟才写的，所以写得比较仓促。我担心涵盖不了题目的所有要求。
    Oh. There were indeed a few parts in my paper that I wrote in the final minutes, so they ended up a bit rushed. I was worried that I wouldn't cover all the requirements of the topic.

9.  I see. That might explain why your arguments aren't set up well. It's often not a good idea to keep reworking your paper.
    我明白了。这或许能解释为什么你的论点组织得不够好。不断地反复修改论文往往不是个好主意。

10. 我确实有这么做。我发现这篇论文比我想象中要难写，因为需要涵盖很多内容。
    I did keep reworking it. I found that this paper was harder to write than I imagined because there was so much to cover.

11. It is indeed a complicated topic. It's easy to lose direction, especially for university-level assignments.
    这个话题确实复杂。很容易迷失方向，尤其是大学程度的作业。

12. 这跟我的中学作业不太一样。我想取得好成绩，但我真的需要帮助。
    It's not like my secondary school assignments. I want to get good grades, but I really need some help.

13. I know a teacher who offers great tutoring sessions on writing papers for first-year students every week. I can give you the details if you're interested.
    我认识一位老师，每周都会给大一新生进行论文写作辅导，效果很不错。如果你有兴趣，我可以把详细情况告诉你。

14. 好的，谢谢您。这听起来真是个好主意。我相信这会对我下一次写论文大有帮助。
    Okay, thank you. That sounds like a great idea. I believe it will really help me improve my next paper.

#70187. Social Worker Directories - Social

1.  Good morning, it's nice to see you. How have you been recently?
    早上好，很高兴见到你。最近怎么样？

2.  你好，我也很高兴能见到你。我最近因为要经常去看望我母亲，她身体不太好。所以我很累。
    Hello, I'm also very glad to see you. Recently, I've been frequently visiting my mother because her health hasn't been good. That's why I'm really tired.

3.  I remember you once said that she has not been well recently. You must have spent several hours going back and forth to her house, right?
    我记得你曾经说过她最近身体不太好。你肯定花了好几个小时来回跑她家，对吧？

4.  是的，要花很多时间。我每周都要去看她，还得工作，几乎没时间做其他事情。
    Yes, it takes a lot of time. I have to visit her every week and also work, so I hardly have time to do anything else.

5.  That sounds very difficult. I heard that you might talk to a social worker. They could help you find services suitable for your mother so that visiting her won't be so tiring.
    听起来真不容易。我听说你可以找社工聊聊。他们可能会帮你看看有没有适合你母亲的服务，这样探望她就不会那么辛苦了。

6.  好主意，我之前不知道还能找到这样的帮助。我该去哪儿找社工的联系方式呢？
    Good idea, I didn't know I could find such help. Where can I get the contact information of a social worker?

7.  There are social worker associations. You can find their services online and on social media. You can also locate social workers near your mom's home. There are online directories available.
    有一些社工协会。你可以在网上和社交媒体上找到他们的服务。你也可以找到离你母亲住处近的社工，还有在线名录可供查找。

8.  谢谢你。有了社工名录的帮助，事情会容易很多。要不然，我真不知道该从哪里开始。
    Thank you. With the help of a social worker directory, things would be much easier. Otherwise, I really wouldn't know where to start.

9.  Yes. Since these are professional organizations, you can find their names listed in directories. Elder care is a sensitive matter, so it's important to find someone qualified.
    是的。由于这些是专业机构，你可以在名录上查到他们的名字。养老问题很敏感，所以找到有资质的人很重要。

10. 感谢你的信息，真的很有帮助。我有很多问题想问他们。如果有人能帮我照顾我妈直到她好起来，我就放心了。
    Thank you for the information; it's really helpful. I have many questions to ask them. If someone could take care of my mother until she gets better, I would feel at ease.

11. It's always hard when parents get old and need help. It's harder when they don't live nearby.
    父母年纪大了需要帮助总是很不容易的，他们不住在附近的话就更不容易了。

12. 我们一直想住得离她近点。在她生病之前，我们就开始看房和准备买房了。但她生病以后，看房计划就搁置了。
    We always want to live closer to her. Before she got sick, we were already looking at houses and planning to buy one. But after she fell ill, our house-hunting plans were put on hold.

13. That's unfortunate. I hope she recovers soon so you can resume your house hunt. There are many houses in this area.
    真可惜。我希望她能快点康复，这样你就能继续找房子了。这一带有很多房子。

14. 是的，我希望我们能找到个好房子。这样我去看望母亲就方便多了。
    Yes, I hope we can find a good place. That way, it will be much more convenient for me to visit my mother.

#70186. Discussing the Upcoming Museum Visit - Education

1.  Hi! I wanted to meet with you to go over the details of the upcoming class trip. I know there are a lot of things to coordinate, so I thought it'd be good to check in.
    你好！我想和你聊聊即将到来的班级旅行的安排。我知道有很多事情要协调，所以想和你确认一下。

2.  您好。真是不好意思，我本来想早点约时间的，但之前一直没能安排上。
    Hi! I'm really sorry. I wanted to set up a meeting earlier, but I was never able to make it.

3.  That's totally fine. You were busy. Can you give me more details about the class trip?
    没关系，你之前很忙。能跟我详细说说班级旅行的安排吗？

4.  当然可以。班级旅行定在两个星期后。我已经让孩子们把同意书带回家给家长签字了。
    Of course! The class trip is in two weeks. I've already asked the students to take the consent forms home for their parents to sign.

5.  Great. I hope the parents can return the consent forms on time, as we can't accept any forms on the day of the trip.
    很好。希望家长能按时交回同意书，因为我们不能在旅行当天再接收新的表格。

6.  是的，我已经通知家长了。同意书的截止日期是出发前三天，因为博物馆的工作人员需要提前确认最终人数。
    Yes, I've already informed the parents. The deadline for submission is three days before departure, as the museum staff need to confirm the final headcount in advance.

7.  Will the children need to bring their own lunch? I'd also like to know if there's a designated area where they can eat.
    孩子们需要自己带午餐吗？另外，那边有专门的用餐区吗？

8.  是的，孩子们可以自己带午餐。博物馆有一个庭院，学生们可以在那里用餐。另外，他们也提供午餐。吃完饭后，孩子们还可以四处走走，等下午的活动开始。
    Yes, they can bring their own lunch. The museum has a courtyard where students can eat. They also offer lunch. After lunch, students can walk around before the afternoon session starts.

9.  That sounds like a great setup. This way, they can have a relaxing lunch break and be refreshed for the afternoon activities.
    听起来安排得很好。这样他们可以放松地吃午餐，下午的活动也能更好地投入。

10. 希望是这样吧。下午他们还有作业要完成，所以需要集中注意力。
    I hope so. They still have assignments to complete in the afternoon, so they'll need to stay focused.

11. I'm really looking forward to this trip. It will be great to see what the students take away from the experience. Plus, it's always fun to see them engage outside the classroom.
    我很期待这次旅行，看看学生们能从中学到什么。而且，能看到他们在课堂外积极参与也会很有趣。

12. 是啊，希望他们既能学到知识，又能玩得开心。他们每次都特别期待班级旅行，总想着能走出教室看看外面的世界。
    Yes! Hopefully, they can learn and have fun at the same time. They always look forward to class trips and are eager to explore beyond the classroom.

13. That's true. You probably need to get back to your class now. Let me know if you have any questions.
    确实是这样。你现在可能要回教室了。如果有问题随时告诉我。

14. 谢谢！我差点忘了。组织旅行真的很有挑战。如果有问题，我会尽快找您。
    Thank you! I almost forgot. Organizing a trip is really challenging. If I run into any issues, I'll reach out to you as soon as possible.

#70185. Trauma Insurance 101 - Business

1.  Good morning. I didn't expect to hear from you again so soon. I hope everything's alright.
    早上好！没想到这么快又收到你的电话，希望一切都顺利。

2.  早上好！谢谢你，一切都挺好的。我知道我们两周前才刚见过面，不过我现在有些保险相关的事情想请你帮忙。
    Good morning! Thanks, everything's going well. I know we just met two weeks ago, but I need your help with some insurance matters.

3.  No problem. Are you looking to adjust your current policy or switch to a different type?
    没问题！你是想调整现有的保单，还是换一种不同的保险产品？

4.  我最近正在考虑一种新的保险。我一直在网上查询有关创伤保险的信息。我想要进一步了解一下。
    I've been looking into a new type of insurance lately. I've been researching trauma insurance online, and I'd like to learn more about it.

5.  Sure! We're more than happy to help with that. I'd be happy to answer all your questions, and I can also give you a quote based on your needs.
    当然！我们很乐意帮忙。我可以解答你的所有问题，也可以根据你的需求给你一个报价。

6.  谢谢你！我想知道创伤保险是不是谁都能买？有没有什么限制？
    Thanks! I'd like to know—can anyone purchase trauma insurance, or are there any restrictions?

7.  Well, trauma insurance generally excludes pre-existing conditions. So, if you already have any pre-existing conditions covered by your current policy, that particular condition won't be covered under trauma insurance.
    嗯，创伤保险一般不保既往病。所以，如果你有什么既往病，现保单也承保，那创伤保险里不会赔付的。

8.  有道理。我现在没有健康问题。但是以后的事情谁知道呢？这个保险能覆盖所有的疾病吗？
    That makes sense. I don't have any health issues right now, but who knows what could happen in the future? Does this insurance cover all illnesses?

9.  Trauma insurance coverage is similar to that of other critical illness policies. It usually includes six major categories, such as heart attacks.
    创伤保险的保障范围和其他重疾险类似，通常涵盖六大类病症，比如心脏病发作。

10. 你也知道，我现在还有一些债要还。如果以后生病了，可能就没办法继续还款了。所以我觉得这个保险可能是个不错的选择。
    You know, I still have some debts to pay off. If I get sick in the future, I might not be able to keep up with the payments. So, I think this insurance could be a good option.

11. Why don't I give you a few quotes? We can discuss your options and see which one is right for you.
    要不我给你一些报价？我们可以讨论讨论你都有哪些选择，看看哪种方案最适合你。

12. 这个计划听起来不错。你可以给我报价的所有信息吗？
    That sounds like a good plan. Can you send me all the details of the quotes?

13. I'll send you a form to fill in. I also need to get some medical information from you to get a quote for this type of insurance.
    我会给你发个表格填写。我还需要收集一些你的健康信息才能给这种保险报价。

14. 好的，没问题。我会尽快填好并寄回给你。
    Alright, no problem. I'll fill it out as soon as possible and send it back to you.

#70184. Tax Deadlines and Accounting Solutions - Business

1.  Good morning. Thank you for calling. What can I do for you today?
    早上好，谢谢你的来电！今天有什么可以帮到你的？

2.  早上好！我有一个自己的生意。我想跟你聊聊，看看你能不能帮我处理一下我生意的会计方面的事情。
    Good morning! I run my own business. I'd like to have a chat and see if you can help me with the accounting side of things.

3.  Of course. We're more than happy to help you. We specialize in business accounting. Could you let me know more about your business and the reason you may need an accountant?
    当然，我们很乐意帮忙！我们专门做商业会计。你可以告诉我更多关于你的生意和你可能需要会计的原因吗？

4.  我开了一家电脑销售店。我一直都是自己做账的。但是，现在我处理不过来了。我需要会计的帮助。
    I run a computer retail store. I've always done the bookkeeping myself, but now it's getting overwhelming. I need an accountant's help.

5.  That actually happens quite often among our clients. Hiring a professional accountant is definitely a great idea. It can help your business grow quickly and avoid more mistakes.
    这种情况在我们的客户中很常见。找一个专业会计绝对是个好主意，不仅能让你的生意更快发展，也更能减少出错。

6.  我完全同意你说的。我也不想犯错误啊。但是我越忙，就越容易犯错。
    I totally agree. I don't want to make mistakes either. But the busier I get, the easier it is to mess up.

7.  It's actually not hard to prevent that. A professional accountant can ensure your accounts are all in order. Do you have any urgent matters that need to be handled right now?
    其实，这并不难避免。专业会计可以帮你把账目整理好。你现在有什么特别紧急的事需要处理吗？

8.  其实，还真的有。对于我来说，目前最紧急的事情就是所得税的申报。还有两天就要截止了。
    Actually, yes. Right now, my biggest concern is filing my income tax. The deadline is in two days.

9.  Don't worry. If you have a professional accountant, there will be sufficient time. But you need to send all the relevant documents to our accountant in one go.
    别担心，有专业会计的话，时间是够的。但你需要一次性把相关文件发给我们的会计。

10. 听你这么说，我真的松了一口气啊。我正在弄了。之前一年的情况其实都很好，但是最近两个月就特别紧迫。
    I'm relieved to hear that. I'm working on it now. The past year was actually fine, but the last two months have been really hectic.

11. Why don't we schedule a meeting to go through everything? We can also discuss what specific services you need.
    我们约个时间详细过一遍吧？也可以讨论一下你具体需要哪些服务。

12. 听上去很完美，谢谢。我想我需要你帮我做所有的事情。我也想更新一下我这边的会计系统。
    That sounds perfect, thanks! I think I need you to handle everything for me. I also want to get my accounting system updated.

13. I'll discuss all the options with you. The right system for business accounting makes everything much simpler and faster.
    我会和你讨论所有可选方案。合适的商业会计系统可以让一切更简单、更高效。

14. 太好了！这样的话，我就能把更多时间放在业务上，而不用担心账务问题了。我等你的安排，谢谢！
    That's great! This way, I can focus more on my business without stressing over accounting. I'll wait for your arrangements—thank you!

#70183. Packing Up and Selling - Business

1.  Hi, I am so glad you have time to meet up. It has been so long since we last met.
    嗨，我真高兴你能抽空见面。自从上次见面已经很久了。

2.  是啊，抱歉我最近太忙了，我准备搬家，有太多事情要做了。
    Yeah, sorry, I've been so busy lately. I'm getting ready to move – there's just too much to do.

3.  All right, I didn't know you were moving! I hope you are not moving so far. I will miss seeing you.
    好吧，我还不知道你要搬家呢！希望你搬得不远，我会想念见到你的。

4.  不会的，我就搬到隔壁区，我以为我跟你说过了。我的房东把房子卖了，我不得不搬家。
    Oh no, I'm only moving to the neighbouring district – I thought I mentioned it. My landlord sold the house, so I have to move.

5.  That sounds stressful. It's hard to rent a place in the area now, and the rent is more expensive.
    听着挺紧张的。现在在这附近租房子很难，而且租金也更贵。

6.  是的，我新的房子更小，而且我们要交的租金还更贵。我想要卖掉一些不用的家具物品，来赚点额外的钱。
    Yes, my new place is smaller, and the rent is even higher. I want to sell some unused furniture to earn some extra cash.

7.  Why not post some advertisements on social media? There are a few sites that let you do that, and it is very easy.
    怎么不在社交媒体上发布广告呢？有几个网站可以发，而且操作很简单。

8.  我也许需要花一些时间来设置这些，但是好在不收钱，这对我们很重要，我们需要尽可能地省钱。
    They might take some time to set up, but luckily, they're free – which is important for us since we need to save money wherever possible.

9.  It is definitely time-consuming to sell your things piece by piece, but it will be worth it, because you can make sure you get the right price for your items.
    一件一件卖东西肯定很耗时，但这是值得的，因为这样能确保物品都卖到合适的价格。

10. 我也许还能拍一些照片，这样可能可以卖得更快，价格更高，尤其是家具之类的大件东西。
    Perhaps I could take some photos; that might help sell them faster and at a higher price, especially for big items like furniture.

11. It sounds like a good idea. I can help you move your things too; that may save you some moving costs, and I can help pack fragile items.
    听起来不错。我也可以帮你搬东西，这样可以节省一些搬家费用，而且我还可以帮忙打包那些易碎物品。

12. 是的，我本来打算自己搬的，这样可以省点钱，能有你帮助可太棒了，谢谢你。
    Yeah, I was planning to move by myself to save money, but having your help is just great – thank you.

13. Of course, I am happy to help you load some boxes and make a few trips. Let me know when you are ready.
    当然，我很乐意帮忙装箱并跑几趟。你准备好了就告诉我。

14. 你可真是个好朋友，我们大概两周之内会打包好所有东西，我到时候再给你打电话。
    You're such a good friend. We'll probably have everything packed within two weeks, and I'll call you then.

#70182. Promotion and Transition - Business

1.  Hi, thank you for meeting me in the morning. How are you today?
    嗨，感谢你今天早上抽时间见我。你今天怎么样？

2.  我很好，谢谢。我也很高兴见到你。我助理说你找我是想跟我谈谈我新工作的事情？
    I'm doing well, thank you. I'm also glad to see you. My assistant mentioned that you wanted to talk about my new job?

3.  Yes. Congrats on your promotion! You deserve it. We have been very pleased with your dedication and skills since you joined our company.
    是的，恭喜你升职！你当之无愧。自从你加入我们公司以来，我们对你的敬业精神和能力非常满意。

4.  谢谢，我很感激，也很感谢你的支持。我很高兴下周就要开始新的工作了。
    Thank you, I really appreciate your support. I'm excited to start my new job next week.

5.  It will be a big change for you, but I'm confident you'll continue to achieve even more, just like before.
    这对你来说是个很大的变化，但我相信你会像以前一样，不断取得更多成就。

6.  我会尽力的，现在要管理的事情太多了，接下来几周我会忙于学习。
    I will do my best. There are so many management tasks now that I'll be busy learning for the next few weeks.

7.  Yes, I also need your help with hiring some new team members; we received notices of resignation from two people today.
    是的，我还需要你帮忙招聘一些新成员；今天我们收到两个人的辞职通知。

8.  我明白了。这不是个好时机啊，我希望他们不是负责新产品的关键项目。
    I understand. This isn't an ideal time—I hope the departing employees weren't involved in the key projects for our new product.

9.  No, but we still need someone to replace them so that the team doesn't work under too much stress. I want you to choose candidates for interviews and help us fill the positions promptly.
    不，但我们还是得找人接替他们，这样团队就不会压力太大。我希望你能挑选候选人进行面试，并尽快补充空缺。

10. 没问题，我很乐意帮忙，但是我不确定我有没有时间，因为我还在处理当前的工作。
    No problem, I'm happy to help, but I'm not sure if I'll have enough time because I'm still handling my current workload.

11. I think it would be best for you to hand over your current responsibilities to your replacement early, so that you can focus on your new job.
    我觉得你最好提前把现在的工作交接给你的接替者，这样你就能专心于新工作了。

12. 好啊，听上去是个不错的计划。我已经准备好了交接的文件，所以我明天就可以开始。
    That sounds like a great plan. I've already prepared the handover documents, so I can start tomorrow.

13. Perfect! I'm glad that you are prepared; that's very efficient. It will make our work a lot easier in the coming weeks.
    完美！我很高兴你已经准备好了，这真高效。这将使我们接下来的工作轻松许多。

14. 我认为到时候会很忙，但是我很期待这种挑战。
    I think it will be very busy then, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.

#70181. From Clinic to Home - Medical

1.  Good afternoon, it's good to see you again. How can I help you today?
    下午好，很高兴再次见到您。今天有什么可以帮您的？

2.  下午好，我很好，谢谢。我想为我父亲来预约个时间。
    Good afternoon, I'm doing well, thank you. I'd like to schedule an appointment for my father.

3.  Of course. Please take a seat and make yourself comfortable. The doctor will be with you shortly. He is on time for appointments today.
    当然，请坐，放轻松。医生很快就会过来，今天他出诊非常准时。

4.  太好了。在我们等待的时候，如果你有几分钟空闲时间，我能请教你一些问题吗？
    That's great. While we wait, if you have a few minutes free, may I ask you some questions?

5.  Sure, no problem. It's quiet at the moment, so I'm free. I just need to pick up the phone if it rings.
    当然，没问题。现在这里很安静，所以我有时间。只不过要是电话响了，我得去接。

6.  我父亲上个月割伤了腿，感染了，伤口需要换药。这就是我们定期来诊所的原因。
    My father cut his leg last month, and it got infected; his wound needs regular dressing changes. That's why we come to the clinic regularly.

7.  I understand. Proper wound dressing is very important to control infection and help the cut heal properly, although it's often uncomfortable.
    我明白。妥善换药对于控制感染和促使伤口正确愈合非常重要，虽然这通常不太舒服。

8.  不是的，他觉得非常疼。每次来诊所对他来说都很折腾。我想知道有没有居家护理护士可以帮忙。
    No, he finds it very painful. Every visit to the clinic is exhausting for him. I wonder if there's a home care nurse available to help.

9.  A home care nurse can handle a range of medical needs. It might be a much easier option in your father's situation.
    居家护理护士可以处理各种医疗需求。对于您父亲的情况来说，这个选择可能轻松得多。

10. 我也觉得。我们两个都觉得现在的情况很麻烦，但是我们不清楚怎么安排，也不清楚跟谁联系。
    I think so too. We both find the current situation very troublesome, but we're not sure how to arrange it or whom to contact.

11. You can ask the doctor about it. He can refer you to a service provider and give you information about the process.
    您可以问问医生。他可以转介您到相关服务机构，并提供办理流程的信息。

12. 哦，太好了。我等会儿就问医生。我本以为这或许比转诊更复杂。感谢您的信息！
    Oh, that's great. I'll ask the doctor shortly. I originally thought this might be more complicated than a referral. Thanks for the information!

13. I'm happy to help. I think you will find that this arrangement works very well. But I will miss seeing you and your father at the clinic.
    我很乐意帮忙。我相信您会发现这个安排非常合适。但我会想念在诊所见到您和您父亲的日子。

14. 我们还会定期来做检查，我们信任这里的医生。您和其他工作人员都非常友善，谢谢！
    We will still come in for regular check-ups because we trust the doctors here. You and the other staff are all very kind—thank you!

#70180. Downsizing After 15 Years - Business

1.  Good afternoon, thank you for calling. Please let me know what help you need today.
    下午好，感谢您的来电。请告诉我今天需要什么帮助。

2.  下午好，我看到你们卖房子的广告，我想要了解这个。
    Good afternoon, I saw your advertisement about selling houses and would like to know more about it.

3.  Of course. Buying and selling properties is my main business, although we do manage rental apartments in town.
    当然。买卖房产是我的主要业务，虽然我们也管理市区的出租公寓。

4.  我有一个七个卧室的房子，离市区不远，我已经在那里住了 15 年了，我想把它卖掉。
    I have a seven-bedroom house not far from the city center. I have lived there for 15 years and now want to sell it.

5.  It must be a big change after 15 years. Fortunately, it's a very good time to sell at the moment, so you picked an opportune time.
    过了 15 年，一定变化很大。好在现在卖房是个不错的时机，所以您选择的时机非常合适。

6.  我的孩子们都搬出去了，所以我想要换一个小房子。但是我不太清楚卖房子的方式都有哪些。
    My children have all moved out, so I want to downsize. However, I'm not very clear about the various methods of selling a house.

7.  It's okay. It's something that all homeowners need to consider before they sell their properties. There are several different options you can consider.
    没关系。卖房前每个房主都需要考虑这个问题。有几种不同的方式，您都可以考虑。

8.  那时我是从我朋友那里买的房子，我对于不同的卖房方式以及各自的优点都不了解。
    I bought the house from a friend, so I'm not familiar with the different selling methods and their advantages.

9.  The size of the house is typical for this area. Private treaty sales can be effective for achieving a realistic price.
    在这个区域，这种房子的面积是常见的。采用私人协议方式销售可以更容易达到一个合理的价格。

10. 我觉得有一个特定的价格是好的。这样的话，我就大概能知道期待的价格是多少了。
    I think having a fixed price is good. That way, I can have an idea of what to expect.

11. Yes. It helps the buyer as well—you have more time to consider all the offers. Unlike auctions, you don't need to set a specific date to sell the property.
    是的，这样也有助于买家，让您有更多时间考虑所有的报价。与拍卖不同，您不需要为出售房产设定一个特定的日期。

12. 听你这样说很好。就像其他卖家一样，我想尽量卖个好价钱。你觉得卖这个房子推荐哪种方式呢？
    That sounds good. Like other sellers, I want to get the best price possible. Which selling method do you recommend for this house?

13. I need to visit your house first. If you are at home Wednesday afternoon, I can come then. You just need to text me your address.
    我需要先去您家看看。若您周三下午在家，我可以那时过来。您发短信告诉我地址就好。

14. 好的，谢谢。这对我来说很合适。期待周三下午见您。祝您有个愉快的一天。
    Alright, thank you. That works well for me. I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday afternoon. Have a great day!

#70179. Stolen Tools Report - Legal

1.  Hello, this is the police assistance hotline. How can I help you?
    你好，这里是警方协助热线。我能帮您什么忙？

2.  你好，我不知道我是否打对了电话号码。我想报案。
    Hello, I'm not sure if I dialled the right number. I'd like to report a crime.

3.  OK. You called the right number. There is a different number if you need to report something very serious.
    好的，您打对了。如果您要报非常严重的案件，会有另一个号码。

4.  好的，不是特别严重的事，但对我来说很重要，没有人有危险，不是很严重。
    Alright, it's not extremely serious, but it's important to me. No one is in immediate danger.

5.  That's good. I understand all sorts of crime can affect the victim. Let's take the crime report.
    那就好。我知道各种犯罪都会影响受害者。我们来记录案情吧。

6.  谢谢，保险公司让我报警, 才能申请理赔。
    Thank you. My insurance company told me to report the crime before filing a claim.

7.  Understood. Please describe the incident in detail.
    明白。请详细描述事发经过。

8.  我是建筑工人，在工地上班。我停在工地的车被撬了，工具全被偷了。我简直不敢相信。
    I'm a construction worker, working on a site. My car parked at the site was broken into, and all my tools were stolen. I just can't believe it.

9.  Sorry to hear that. Tools, especially power tools, are always common targets for thieves since they can sell them online or to shops.
    听到这个消息我感到非常抱歉。工具，尤其是电动工具，总是小偷盯上的常见目标，因为他们可以把工具在网上卖掉，或者卖给商店。

10. 如果小偷把他们卖到商店，警察可能会找到，和其他人一样，我在上面刻了信息。这样能帮助追查吗？
    If the thief sells them to shops, the police might trace them. Like many others, I had my details engraved on them. Will that help tracking/ Will that help with the investigation?

11. Excellent precaution! This significantly improves recovery chances. We'll do our best to investigate the incident and recover your property if possible.
    这个预防措施很好。能大大提高找回几率。我们会尽力调查此事，并在可能的情况下追回您的财物。

12. 我买了保险是很好的。即使没有找到，也可以向保险公司申请理赔。我的保险涵盖盗窃损失，但需要案件编号，才能启动理赔。
    It's great that I have insurance; even if nothing is recovered, I can still file a claim with my insurer. My insurance covers theft losses, but I need a case number to initiate the claim.

13. Yes. We still need more details about the crime. Please provide any additional information you can remember. Then I'll fill out the official report and email it to you for your claim.
    是的，我们还需要更多关于案件的细节。请把你能记得的其他信息提供给我，然后我会把正式报案记录填写好，并通过邮件发给你，好让你申请理赔。

14. 好的，谢谢您的帮助。我再仔细回想一下，如果我能想起来任何别的细节，我再跟您联系。
    Alright, thank you for your help. I'll think it over carefully, and if I recall any additional details, I'll get back to you.

#70178. Settling In and Planting Seeds - Social

1.  Hi, long time no see! How's everything going?
    好久不见！最近一切都好吗？

2.  你好啊！搬到一个新国家，对一个家庭来说，确实是个很大的挑战。不过，我们真的很喜欢这里。
    Hi! Moving to a new country is indeed a big challenge for a family, but we really love it here.

3.  That's good. I am glad to hear that. It's brave of you to move to a new country when you are not familiar with it.
    太好了，我很高兴听你这么说。你在对这里还不熟悉的情况下，就搬来一个新的国家，真的很勇敢。

4.  即使我不熟悉这里，我们很兴奋，我想，等我们找到新朋友，孩子们也去上学了，我们就会觉得这边的生活舒适自由。
    Even though I'm not familiar with this place, we're very excited. I think once we make new friends and the kids start school, we'll feel that life here is comfortable and free.

5.  I'm sure you will. I don't mind being your first friend. Let me know if you need help meeting people.
    一定会的。我愿意成为你的第一个朋友。如果需要我帮忙认识新朋友，尽管开口。

6.  谢谢你！这很暖心。事实上，我想问下这附近有花园用品商店吗？
    Thank you. That's so sweet. Actually, I'd like to ask if there are any garden supplies stores around here?

7.  It depends on what type of garden supplies you need. There are two gardening centres.
    这要看你需要什么样的园艺用品。这里有两家园艺中心。

8.  我在自己国家有一个花园，我想买点种子，你觉得哪种种子好？
    Back in my home country I had a garden, and now I want to buy some seeds. Which kind do you think is good?

9.  It depends on the weather. Some seeds grow very well. You can ask one of our neighbours.
    这要看天气，有些种子长得特别好。你可以问问我们的邻居。

10. 啊，那好的。我还没见过他呢。如果我想跟他聊聊园艺的事儿，去敲他的门，会不会冒昧啊？他会介意吗？
    Ah, alright. I haven't met him yet. If I want to talk with him about gardening and knock on his door, would that be too forward? Do you think he'd mind?

11. No, not at all. I can introduce you to him if you like. He has a good garden, and he knows where to buy seeds.
    不会的，完全不会。如果你愿意，我可以把他介绍给你。他的花园打理得很好，也很清楚哪里可以买到种子。

12. 太好了！我很好奇在不同国家，不同气候，能种些什么种子。
    Great! I'm really curious about what kinds of seeds can be grown in different countries and climates.

13. Let me know if you start. I can help you if you like. Keep me posted! I've got spare tools you can borrow.
    如果你开始动手，告诉我一声。如果你需要，我可以帮忙。随时告诉我进展！我有多余的工具可以借给你。

14. 谢谢，我很感激你的帮忙，我很高兴能在这里种菜。能继续园艺的爱好，也让我对新生活充满了期待。
    Thank you, I really appreciate your help. I'm so happy to be able to grow vegetables here. Continuing my passion for gardening makes me look forward to my new life.

#70177. Booking a 100th Birthday Shoot - Business

1.  Good morning! Thanks for calling Photography Moments. This is Penny speaking
    早上好！感谢致电"摄影时刻"，我是佩妮。

2.  你好，佩妮，我想预约拍一些照片。有人向我推荐了你，说你是很棒的家庭摄影师。
    Hi Penny, I'd like to book a photoshoot. Someone recommended you to me and said you're an amazing family photographer.

3.  That's lovely to hear! Many of my clients come back to capture different moments in their lives.
    真高兴听到这个！我的很多客户都会回来，记录他们人生中的不同时刻。

4.  我觉得和一个摄影师长期合作是很好的。我认为和别人一起工作一段时间也是很好的。照片很重要，没有照片的话，很难记住很多人生重要时刻。
    I think it's great to work with a photographer long-term. I believe working with someone over time is really beneficial. Photos are so important—without them, it's hard to remember many of life's important moments.

5.  That's so true! I enjoy giving reminders of capturing special occasions and meaningful moments. It's also fun to meet different people.
    太对了！我喜欢帮大家记录捕捉那些特别的日子和有意义的时刻。而且，认识新的人也很有趣。

6.  我的好祖母快 100 岁了，我想给她拍一些照片，庆祝她的生日。
    My dear grandmother is almost 100 years old, and I'd like to have her photographed to celebrate her birthday.

7.  Wow! What a fabulous milestone! That's a wonderful way to celebrate her birthday. Would you like to include other family members in the photos?
    哇！这可是一个了不起的里程碑/大事啊！用这种方式庆祝她的生日可太棒了。你想让其他家人一起入镜吗？

8.  是的，她特别希望和孙辈们一起合影，对她来说，这很重要。但孙辈们还太小，可能以后记不住她了。
    Yes, she really wants to have photos taken with her grandchildren. It means a lot to her. But her grandchildren are still so young that they might not remember her in the future.

9.  Of course. It's such a good idea. Sounds like you'd prefer a cozy, candid family shoot rather than formal portraits, is that right?
    当然啦。这主意真好。听起来你更想要温馨自然的家庭照，而不是正式的人像照，对吧？

10. 是的，我想在家里拍一些可爱的随意的照片。我不想要正式的摆拍的照片，那样每个人看上去都不自在。
    Yes, I'd like to take some lovely, casual photos at home. I don't want formal, posed pictures because they make everyone look uncomfortable.

11. Absolutely! Formal photos are not necessarily unnatural, but I do find people nowadays prefer a natural, relaxed look in their photos.
    完全理解！正式照也不一定会不自然，不过我确实发现，现在的人更喜欢自然随性的照片。

12. 请问你有摄影的价格表吗？这样我可以看看不同的拍摄方案，决定选择拍哪种类型。
    Do you have a photography price list? That way I can look at the different session options and decide which type to book.

13. Yes! I'll send it to you. We actually have some special deal sessions at the moment, so I'll include those too.
    当然！我会把价格表发给你。我们现在正好有一些优惠拍摄套餐，我也一并发你。

14. 谢谢你的帮助。我先看看价格表，等我准备好预定了，再给你打电话。
    Thanks for your help! I'll take a look at the price list, and I'll call you when I'm ready to book.

#70176. Birthday Party Venue Planning - Social

1.  Hi, it's good to see you. I've bought some coffee and cakes for us.
    嗨，见到你真开心。我给我们买了咖啡和蛋糕。

2.  太好了，谢谢你。我也很高兴见到你。我们有段时间没见了。
    That's great, thank you! I'm happy to see you too. It's been a while since we last met.

3.  It's been way too long! It's ridiculous that we only live three streets apart! But life gets so busy. And your big birthday is coming up!
    真是太久没见了！我们才相隔三条街，(居然还没见面)，真是不可思议！但是生活变得太忙了。另外，快到你的重要生日了！

4.  哦，天啊，是的。我还有很多事情要做。我还没有定场地，邀请函也还没有发出去。
    Oh gosh, yes! I still have so much to do. I haven't booked a venue yet, and I haven't even sent out the invitations.

5.  I thought you were going to have it at your place? I remember we talked about it last time anyway.
    我记得你说过要在家里办，不是吗？总之我记得上次我们聊过这个。

6.  原本我是这样计划的。但是客人名单一直在增加，现在还有很多家人要从海外过来。
    That was the original plan. But the guest list just keeps growing, and now a lot of my family members are coming from overseas.

7.  How about the community hall? It's really nice, and I don't think it's expensive to hire. A friend of mine had her wedding there.
    要不考虑一下社区大厅？那里环境挺不错的，我觉得租金应该也不贵。我有个朋友就在那儿办的婚礼。

8.  我已经有一段时间没去社区大厅了。但是我上次去的时候，我觉得那儿的厨房不太好。
    I haven't been there for a while. But the last time I went there, I didn't think the kitchen was very good.

9.  Oh, it's been updated recently. It's now a commercial-grade kitchen. I think they offer a suitable catering service.
    哦，那里最近升级了，现在是商业级厨房了。我觉得他们提供的餐饮服务很合适。

10. 哦，那样的话，那里可能确实是个完美的场地。因为有太多客人要来了，我肯定需要安排餐饮服务。
    Oh, then that might actually be a perfect venue. Because with so many guests coming, I definitely need catering.

11. If you need a place for your guests to stay, I have two spare rooms. I'd be happy to host your family.
    如果你需要给客人安排住的地方，我家有两个空房间，欢迎你家人住我这儿。

12. 哦，谢谢你，那太好了。但是我还不确定他们想要住在哪儿。如果我确实需要额外的床位，我会给你打电话的。
    Oh, thank you! That's really kind. But I'm not sure where they'd like to stay yet. If I do need extra beds, I'll give you a call.

13. Sure! I'm really looking forward to your birthday party. Do let me know if you need help—especially on the day.
    当然！我真的很期待你的生日派对。有需要帮忙的话，一定告诉我，特别是当天。

14. 我想我可能会采纳你的建议。我先把场地订好，确认好宾客名单。如果我需要帮忙，我就给你打电话。
    I think I may take your advice. First, I'll book the venue and finalise the guest list. If I need help, I'll call you.

#70175. Drainage Concerns - Business

1.  Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Streamline Drainage Services. This is Marion, one of the drainage specialists here. How can I help you today?
    下午好，感谢致电顺流排水服务。我是马里恩，这边的一位排水专家。今天我能帮您些什么？

2.  下午好，我家的排水有问题，我朋友推荐我给您打电话求助。
    Good afternoon. I'm having some drainage issues at my place, and a friend recommended that I call you for help.

3.  Well, we always appreciate referrals from happy customers! Could you tell me more about the drainage problem you're experiencing?
    嗯，我们一直都很感激满意客户的推荐。您能再说说遇到了什么排水问题吗？

4.  我住在这个房子里两年了，之前一直都没问题。但是最近遇到了积水问题，而且情况越来越糟了。
    I've been living in this house for two years, and it had always been fine. But recently, I've been having a water pooling problem, and it's getting worse.

5.  That doesn't sound good. There are a lot of possible causes. Can you give me more details?
    听起来不太妙。有可能导致积水的原因有很多，能跟我具体描述一下吗？

6.  我家后花园的地势是向房子这边倾斜的。下大雨的时候，雨水会顺着坡流下来，积攒在房屋周围。
    My back garden slopes toward the house. When it rains heavily, the water runs down the slope and pools around the house.

7.  I see. If the flooding only started recently, there must have been some changes around your property.
    明白了。如果积水是最近才出现的，那周围环境一定发生了什么变化。

8.  既然您提到了这一点，我家后面同一地块的邻居最近几周一直在装修。
    Now that you mention it, the neighbor on the same lot behind my house has been renovating for the past few weeks.

9.  That's interesting. It could definitely be related, especially if they've added something like a deck or made changes to the landscape of the yard.
    有意思。这很可能有关系，尤其是如果他们加盖了像是露台这样的东西，或者改动了院子的地形。

10. 听起来您很了解这方面的问题，我能请您过来帮我看看出了什么问题吗？
    You sound like you really know your stuff. Would you be able to come over and take a look?

11. Of course. We need to identify the exact problem before figuring out the best solution. Hopefully, it'll be an easy fix.
    当然。我们得先找出问题的根源，才能决定最好的解决方案。希望这个问题好处理。

12. 我也是这样希望的。如果您明天有空，我明天一整天都在家。您随时过来都可以。
    I hope so too. If you're available tomorrow, I'll be home all day, so you can come anytime.

13. Unfortunately, I'm not available tomorrow, but I can come the day after if that works for you.
    很抱歉，明天我不行，但后天可以，不知道您方便吗？

14. 好的，后天可以的。谢谢您这么快就能过来排查问题。我真希望在此期间不会再下雨了。
    Alright, the day after tomorrow works for me. Thanks for coming over so quickly to check things out. I really hope it doesn't rain again before then.

    当然！我们非常感谢我们的老顾客。您可以告诉我您的需求吗？这样我可以为您提供最合适的帮助。

4.  我正在考虑买船，但是我觉得在买之前，我应该了解一下为船投保需要花多少钱。
    I'm thinking about buying a boat, but before I do, I'd like to get an idea of how much boat insurance would cost.

5.  That sounds exciting! It's definitely a smart move to check insurance costs before making such a big purchase.
    听起来很棒！在这样一笔大开销之前，先了解保险费用绝对是个聪明的决定。

6.  是的，我还想给我的车买一个拖车，我想确保我能承担得起所有的开销。
    Yes, I'm also planning to get a trailer for my car. I just want to make sure I can afford all the expenses.

7.  That makes sense! It's important to have everything properly insured in case of an accident. What type of boat are you considering?
    很有道理！确保所有东西都投保好，以防发生意外是很重要的。您打算买哪种船呢？

8.  我正考虑买一个带船舱的游艇。我的孩子们都很喜欢水上运动，一直要我买船。
    I'm thinking about getting a yacht with a cabin. My kids love water sports and have been asking me to get a boat.

9.  That sounds like a fantastic way to enjoy quality time with your family. Motoring on water is really popular, and a yacht would be great for that!
    这听起来是个和家人共享美好时光的很棒的方式。水上驾驶很受欢迎，游艇确实是个不错的选择！

10. 是的，我想和孩子们一起出去野餐，享受在夏天游泳的乐趣。
    Yes! I'd love to take them out for picnics and enjoy swimming in summer.

11. We offer a range of insurance policies for different types and sizes of boats. Plus, we have discounts for customers who already have policies with us.
    我们提供针对不同类型和尺寸船只的各种保险保单。此外，对于已经在我们公司投保的客户，还有折扣优惠。

12. 是的，我也有买你们的其他保险。我的汽车和房屋保险都是在你们公司买的，所以我才给你打电话问报价。
    Yes, I also have other policies with you. My car and home insurance are both with your company. This is why I called you to ask for a quote.

13. That's great! If you can provide me with more details about your boat, I can connect you with an agent to get a quote.
    太好了！如果您能提供更多关于船的详细信息，我可以帮您联系代理，看看报价。

14. 是的，我准备了详细的信息，而且我现在有时间。太好了，非常感谢你。
    Yes, I've got all the details ready, and I have time now. That's perfect—thank you so much!

#70173. Water Restrictions in Australia - Social+Legal

1.  Good morning, thank you for your call. How can I help you today?
    早上好，感谢您的来电。我能帮您什么忙吗？

2.  我刚搬到这里，我有些关于用水限制的问题。
    I just moved here, and I have some questions about water restrictions.

3.  I'd be happy to help. Right now, we're at Level Two water restrictions.
    我很乐意帮忙。目前我们处于二级水限制。

4.  我刚来到澳大利亚，不熟悉用水限制。我邻居说这跟降雨量不足有关。
    I just came to Australia, and I'm not familiar with the water restrictions. My neighbor said it has something to do with low rainfall.

5.  Yes, that's right. Because of low rainfall, we need to conserve water. That means there are certain rules about how and when you can use it at home.
    没错，因为降雨量不足，我们需要节约用水。这意味着家里用水会有一些规则，关于怎么用水和什么时候用水。

6.  我明白了。那很有道理。在我的国家，我们有季风，干旱，洪水。这些甚至比降水量少更严重，我知道在澳大利亚的情况不一样。
    I see. That makes a lot of sense. In my country, we have monsoons, droughts, and floods. Those are even worse than low rainfall. I know the situation is different in Australia.

7.  Exactly. When we don't get enough rain, the water levels in the reservoirs behind dams drop, which affects our drinking water supply. This is a problem.
    没错。如果降雨不足，大坝后的水库水位就会下降，这会影响我们的饮用水供应。这是个问题。

8.  但是，在天气很热很干的时候，我的草坪和花园都会被影响到。我可以给它们浇水吗？
    But when it's really hot and dry, my lawn and garden get affected. Am I allowed to water them?

9.  Yes, you can, but only with a watering can. And you should do it before 10AM or after 4 PM—just not in the middle of the day.
    是的，您可以，但只能用浇水壶。而且您应该在早上 10 点之前或下午 4 点之后浇水，不要在中午时分。

10. 好的，我会照你说的做的。我会去园艺中心买个喷壶。我想我们只能希望早点下雨。
    Got it! I'll follow the rules. I'll go to a gardening center to buy a watering can. I guess we can only hope for some rain soon.

11. If you need more information about water restrictions, you can check the council's website. There's a page with all the details.
    如果您需要更多关于用水限制的信息，可以查阅市政网站。网站上有一页详细介绍所有内容。

12. 听起来很不错。我会去网站上看看的。我不想因为不熟悉规定而做错事情。
    That sounds great. I'll check out the website. I don't want to make any mistakes because I'm not familiar with the rules.

13. Restrictions will change as well. You can sign up for notifications on the website, so you'll always be updated. This would help you.
    限制也会发生变化。您可以在网站上注册接收通知，这样您就能随时获得更新。这会帮助您。

14. 这是个好主意。谢谢你今天的帮助。我现在就去网站上看看。
    That's a good idea. Thanks for your help today. I'll go check out the website now.

#70172. Looking for a Foster Pet - Social

1.  Good morning! Welcome to the animal shelter. Let me know how I can help you today.
    早上好！欢迎来到动物收容所。我今天能怎么帮助你呢？

2.  你好，我经常从这里路过。我看到你们门上贴了关于小猫和小狗的领养海报。
    Hi! I walk past here quite often. I saw some adoption posters for kittens and puppies on your door.

3.  I can introduce you to our adoption options, whether you're interested in a dog, a cat, or even a bird. We also have some rabbits at the moment.
    我可以给你介绍我们的领养选项，你可以选择狗、猫，甚至是鸟。我们现在还有一些兔子哦。

4.  我现在还不能正式领养宠物，但是我可以暂时照看动物。
    I can't officially adopt a pet right now, but I can foster animals temporarily.

5.  That's also great! Temporary fostering helps us a lot. It's also beneficial to the animals, but we expect you to commit to it for at least one month.
    那也太棒了！临时寄养对我们帮助很大，对动物们也很有好处。但我们希望你至少能照顾一个月。

6.  我很乐意照顾动物一个月。但是我不知道猫还是狗更适合我。
    I'd love to foster for a month. But I'm not sure whether a cat or a dog would be a better fit for me.

7.  Dogs and cats have different needs. It depends on your living situation and personal preference.
    猫狗的需求不太一样，这主要取决于你的生活环境和个人喜好。

8.  我和我的老父亲住在一起，我们都喜欢狗。不过，我的父亲拄着拐杖，我们不能照顾太活泼的狗。
    I live with my elderly father, and we both love dogs. But my father uses a cane, so we can't handle a dog that's too energetic.

9.  Even though some well-behaved big dogs are great companions, they may not be ideal for the elderly or those with mobility issues. A small dog might be a better choice.
    尽管一些性格温顺的大狗很适合作伴，但它们可能不太适合老人或者行动不便的人。一只小狗可能会更合适。

10. 小狗更容易遛。我在你们的海报上看到了一只毛茸茸的小狗。
    Small dogs are easier to walk. I saw a fluffy little dog on your poster.

11. Yes, I know which dog you're talking about. It's well-behaved and would be a good fit for you and your father.
    对，我知道你说的是哪只狗。它很乖，应该很适合你和你父亲。

12. 太棒了！我想领养它。我需要办理什么手续？虽然我不太了解具体流程，但我很开心能做这件事。
    This is amazing! I want to adopt it. What paperwork do I need to complete? I'm not too familiar with the process, but I'm really happy to do this.

13. You need to fill out an application form first. Once that's done, we will conduct a home visit to ensure your living environment is suitable for a dog.
    你需要先填写一份申请表。填好后，我们会进行一次家访，来确保你的居住环境是适合养狗的。

14. 我明白了，没问题。我可以现在就填表格！我很期待和父亲一起照顾这个小家伙。
    Got it, no problem! I can fill out the form right now. I'm really looking forward to taking care of this little one with my father.

#70171. Enrol to Vote - Legal

1.  Good morning, welcome. I believe you're here for some information about voting in Australia.
    早上好，欢迎。我想您是来了解澳大利亚的投票信息的吧。

2.  可不是嘛。我知道全国大选没多久了，我想知道我能不能投票。
    Exactly. I know the national election is coming up soon, and I'd like to know if I'm eligible to vote.

3.  You can enroll to vote if you're a citizen and over 18 years old.
    如果您是公民，并且年满 18 岁，就可以登记投票。

4.  我当然不止 18 岁了，我去年 6 月份成为了澳大利亚公民，我还有护照。
    I'm definitely over 18! I became an Australian citizen last June, and I have my passport.

5.  Great. You must also have lived at your current address for more than one month in order to vote.
    很好。您还需要在现住址居住超过一个月，才可以投票。

6.  当然，我在这里住了 3 年了。我还不太明白怎么注册，你能解释一下吗？
    Of course, I've lived here for three years. I'm still not clear on how to enroll—could you explain?

7.  Before you can vote, you have to include your name on the roll. You can enroll online using your passport as proof of identity.
    在投票之前，您需要把名字加入选民名单。您可以通过护照在网上登记，作为身份证明。

8.  听起来这是最容易的办法。我还想了解其他注册方法，有时候因为我住的地方的网络问题，我没办法上网。
    That sounds like the easiest way. I'd like to know about other methods to enrol. Sometimes, the internet where I live has issues, so I can't get online.

9.  You can print the enrollment form from the election website, and then mail or email it to the election office. Or you can visit the election office and enrol in person.
    您可以从选举网站打印注册表，然后邮寄或电邮给选举办公室。您也可以亲自到选举办公室注册。

10. 谢谢，现在我有更多选择了。我会尽早注册，我不想错过投票，离大选已经没几个月了。
    Thank you, I have more options now. I'll enrol as soon as possible. I don't want to miss voting, and the election is only a few months away.

11. By law, Australian citizens must vote, or you'll be fined if you don't. You're doing the right thing by enrolling early.
    根据法律，澳大利亚公民必须投票，否则会被罚款。您现在注册是个正确的选择。

12. 我之前不知道，投票让我很兴奋。我会去查看网站并且注册，谢谢你的帮助，和你交谈很高兴。
    I didn't know that before. I'm excited to vote! I'll check the website and enroll. Thanks for your help; it's been nice talking with you.

6.  是的，这对她非常好。学习语言可以帮她为出国做好准备，旅游也会更轻松，还可以让她更好地和当地人交流。
    Yes, it's really good for her. Learning a language will help her get ready for going overseas, make traveling easier, and allow her to communicate better with the locals.

7.  That's an excellent idea. We have several young students here. They are also learning a new language to travel overseas after school.
    这是个很好的主意。我们这里有好几个年轻学生，他们也在学一门新语言，以便毕业后能去海外旅行。

8.  很高兴听到其他同学也是这样的。她准备去欧洲旅游。大部分的时间，她会在西班牙。
    I'm glad to hear that other students are doing the same. She plans to travel around Europe, and she'll spend most of her time in Spain.

    好的。我们确实提供西班牙语课程。下一期的初级班是下个月底开。这个时机应该很合适。

11. We may be able to arrange some lessons that suit her in the meantime. Why don't we meet up and discuss the options?
    在这期间，我们也许可以安排一些适合她的课程。我们见面聊聊看都有哪些选择，您看怎么样？

12. 那太好了，但我们要上学和工作，很难在白天的时候见面。
    That sounds great, but with school and work, it's hard for us to meet during the day.

13. That won't be a problem. Most of the classes are in the evenings or on weekends. I'm sure we can find a suitable time.
    这不是问题。大部分课程都是在晚上或周末。我相信我们能找到合适的时间。

14. 谢谢你，我会和女儿商量好时间，再打电话来预约的。
    Thank you! I'll discuss a time with my daughter and call back to make an appointment.

    That would make me so happy! I hope we can find a good place to bring everyone together. My daughter and I haven't decided on the venue yet.

7.  Oh dear. It can be hard to find a good place. If she wants to have a formal one, I know somewhere good. It's a new restaurant that overlooks a lovely beach.
    哎呀，找个好地方确实不容易。如果她想办个正式的，我知道一个不错的地方。是一家新开的餐厅，能看到美丽的海滩景色。

8.  她确实想要一个正式的仪式。她希望每个人都盛装出席，或者，至少穿得正式一点。她想办一个酒会，而不是坐下吃饭的晚宴。
    She does want a formal ceremony. She hopes everyone will dress up, or at least wear something a bit formal. She's thinking of having a cocktail party, not a sit-down banquet.

9.  That restaurant is perfect for her then. There is a beautiful beach view with a deck outside and fancy décor inside.
    那家餐厅就很适合她呀，外面有个露台可以看到海滩，里面的装饰也很高级。

10. 听起来很好呀。她现在还在考虑呢，因为有太多选择了，真不好决定呀。
    Sounds great! She's still thinking about it—there are so many options, it's hard to make a decision.

    如果你需要，我很愿意帮忙。我现在退休了，以前做了好几年活动策划。

12. 我还真不知道你以前做过活动策划呀！我们确实需要帮忙。我和我女儿已经忙不过来了，都压得喘不过来气了。你能抽时间帮我们，真的是太慷慨了！我太感激了！
    I didn't know you used to work as an event planner! We really need help. My daughter and I are swamped, we're barely keeping up. It's so generous of you to offer your time. I'm really grateful.

13. I'm happy to help if you would like. I can meet you and your daughter in a few days to talk more.
    如果你愿意的话, 我很乐意帮忙的。我们可以过几天再见面，跟你和你女儿详细聊聊。

14. 太好了！有你的帮忙真是太好了！很开心能在这里遇见你！

    这真是个好主意！我觉得联系本地商店是让社区参与的好办法。你觉得我们应该组织什么样的活动来实现这个目标呢？

6.  我觉得这次活动可以跟动物有关。你觉得跟本地的动物收容所合作怎么样？
    I think this event could be animal-related. What do you think about cooperating with the local animal shelter?

7.  What do you think about organizing a native animal show? We can advertise locally, and I think it would be a hit with families. It would offer something fresh and different.
    你觉得组织一个本地动物展怎么样？我们可以在本地宣传，我觉得家庭会很喜欢。这可以带来一些新鲜和不同的体验。

8.  听起来很棒呀！大家可以去动物收容所参观，看看被救助的猫和狗。参观完，还可以领养动物。
    It sounds great! People can visit the animal shelter and see the rescued cats and dogs. After the visit, they can also adopt animals.

9.  Absolutely! We can raise more funds to benefit these animals. By encouraging people to adopt, we not only give these animals a new home but also reduce the strain on the shelter.
    当然可以！我们可以筹集更多资金来帮助这些动物。通过鼓励人们领养，不仅能给这些动物一个新家，还能减轻收容所的压力。

10. 好的，这件事我可以做。我们需要找到一些志愿者，来帮我们组织这次活动。这样可以帮助我们降低预算和费用。
    Sure, I can take care of this. We need to find some volunteers to help us organize the event. This way, we can help keep our budget and cost down.

11. Yes, we'll need a group of volunteers to help plan the event details. Their support will be essential for organizing everything smoothly. By working together, we can keep our cost down and ensure the event is successful.
    是的，我们需要一组志愿者来帮忙策划活动的细节。他们的帮助对顺利组织一切是非常重要的。通过合作，我们可以降低成本，确保活动成功。

12. 好的，听起来不错！那我们可以聊聊活动的具体安排，还有怎么协调我们的工作。
    Great, that sounds good! Let's talk about the specific arrangements for the event and how we can coordinate our work.

13. Sure! We also need to get the word out about the event and aim for as many people as possible to notice it. It's important to get a big crowd to join it.
    没问题！我们还需要宣传这个活动，尽量让更多人注意到它。吸引大批人参与是很重要的。

14. 我同意你的看法。我们可以约定几天后再深入讨论一下活动的细节。我也会准备一些资料，发给你们。期待我们的合作！
    I agree with you. We can schedule to discuss the details of the event further in a few days. I'll also prepare some materials and send them to you. I'm looking forward to working together!

    I'm really glad you called to ask me. I've been wanting to set up a time to meet with you and chat.

3.  You mentioned before that changing schools was a good thing for your daughter, but it seems she's encountering some issues now.
    你之前跟我说, 你感觉换学校对你女儿来说很好，但好像现在她遇到了一些问题。

4.  是的，转学以后，她的成绩有提高。但是，她在社交方面好像有些困难。她到现在还没有交到任何新朋友呢。
    Yes, her grades have improved since the transfer. However, she seems to be having some difficulties socially. She still hasn't made any new friends.

5.  It's great that her grades have improved; that's a very positive sign. Just give her some time to adjust to the school, and gradually she will start making friends.
    她的成绩有提高是很棒的。这是个很积极的信号。就多给她点时间去适应学校吧，然后渐渐地，她就会开始交朋友了。

6.  或许吧。我有点担心她。她没有跟我说过什么，但是我知道，她感觉非常孤独。我也不希望她的成绩下降。
    Maybe. I'm a bit worried about her. She hasn't said anything to me, but I know she feels very lonely. I don't want her grades to drop either.

7.  Perhaps you could help her find some after school activities that suit her. That way, she might meet some students in similar situations. What does she enjoy doing?
    也许你可以给她看看有没有适合她的课外活动。这样她或许可以遇见和她有相似处境的学生。她喜欢做什么呢?

    She was in the band at her previous school. When she left, she was still learning in the band. She seemed to really enjoy the band activities.

9.  I think the school band is a great idea. It can give her a chance to make friends in a small group setting.
    我认为学校乐队是很好的想法。这可以给她一个在小团体里结交朋友的机会。

10. 您真的说到点子上了。她以前是学吹长笛的。我可以和乐队老师确认一下，看一看还能不能让她继续学。
    You've really hit the mark. She used to play the flute. I can check with the band teacher to see if she can continue learning.

11. She could even learn a new instrument. She might also be interested in learning something new. It depends on the band's display arrangements such as the setlist and stage setup.
    她甚至可以学个新乐器。她应该也会对学习新东西感兴趣。这要看乐队的演出安排，比如曲目清单和舞台布置。

12. 她马上就放学回家了。我会和她聊一聊。看她想不想尝试一下进乐队。
    She will be home from school soon. I'll talk to her and see if she wants to try joining the band.

13. Alright. You can encourage her to give it a try. Encourage her to put in some extra effort. I think that would be very helpful.
    好的。你可以鼓励她试试看。鼓励她多努力一点。我觉得这会很有帮助。

14. 我同意您说的。我很难知道还能再为她做些什么了。但和您聊过以后，真的帮到我很多。谢谢您。
    I agree with what you said. I find it hard to know what else I can do for her. But talking with you has really helped me a lot. Thank you.

    你好！很高兴看到你过来！进来吧！你想来杯咖啡吗？

2.  你好呀。给我来杯咖啡吧！谢谢你！我有一个非常让人兴奋的想法，想跟你讨论一下。
    Hi! I'd love a cup of coffee. Thank you! I have an exciting idea that I'd like to discuss with you.

3.  Wow, that sounds very intriguing! I'm interested. I love to hear exciting ideas. Why not sit down and have a chat with me?
    哇，听起来很有趣！我很感兴趣。我很想听听你的想法。不如坐下来我们聊聊？

4.  昨天，我遇到一位女士。她刚搬到我家对面。我突然意识到，我对住在这里的很多人，都不太熟悉。
    Yesterday, I met a lady who just moved in across from my home. I suddenly realized that I'm not very familiar with many people living here.

5.  Yes, you don't say. Loads of new people have moved here over the past six months. I don't know them either.
    是啊，你说得对。过去六个月里有很多新搬过来的人，我也不认识他们。

6.  下周末，我们找一个下午，举办一个聚会吧？这样可以有一个不错的机会，让大家可以互相见见面，还可以吃点东西，喝点东西。
    How about we organize a gathering one afternoon next weekend? It would be a great opportunity for everyone to meet, and we can have some snacks and drinks.

7.  It sounds fantastic. I think it won't be too difficult to organize this gathering. We can just do it casually. Let's do it next weekend.
    听起来很棒！我觉得组织这个聚会不会太难。我们可以随意点。我们就下周末搞吧。

8.  好的。我想，现在最重要的事情是，我们可以告诉大家，那天下午有空了就可以来参加。不需要太正式。
    Great. I think the most important thing now is to let everyone know that they're welcome to join that afternoon if they are free. It doesn't need to be too formal.

9.  I still have the decorations from my last party. We can use them. I don't think we need music at the gathering. After all, our main goal is to chat and connect with each other.
    我还有上次聚会的装饰品。我们可以用它们。我觉得聚会不需要音乐，毕竟我们的主要目的是聊天和互相认识。

10. 没错。最重要的事情是让大家知道聚会即将举行。我们要尽快发邀请函。
    Exactly. The most important thing is to let everyone know that the gathering is coming up. We should send out the invitations as soon as possible.

11. That sounds really exciting! Once the invitations are ready, do let me know. I'll help you deliver them to everyone. And if I run into them, I'll be sure to mention it as well.
    听起来真令人激动！一旦邀请函准备好了，记得告诉我。我帮你发给大家。如果我遇到他们，我也会告诉他们这件事的。

12. 我喜欢烹饪。我很乐意准备食物。我可能没有计划做什么特别的食物，就准备一些小吃吧。
    I enjoy cooking, and I'd be happy to prepare some food. I might not plan anything special, just some snacks.

13. We could go to the supermarket to get some supplies and drinks. I can't wait to make my favorite iced lemon tea.
    我们可以去超市买一些材料和喝的东西。我迫不及待想做我最爱的冰镇柠檬茶了。

14. 太好了！谢谢你！这一定会很有趣！我很期待通过这个活动更了解我的新邻居们。
    That sounds great! Thank you! This is going to be so much fun! I'm really looking forward to getting to know my new neighbors through this event.

#70161. Legal Consultation for Selling a Small Business - Legal

1.  Good morning. Thanks for your call. How can I help you?
    早上好。感谢您的来电。我能怎么帮助您？

2.  早上好。我需要咨询一些法律建议。我看到你们的网站上说，你们专门针对小生意提供法律建议。
    Good morning. I need some legal advice. I saw on your website that you specialize in providing legal advice for small businesses.

3.  Yes, that's correct. We provide business owners with advice on commercial and employment matters. Why do you need legal advice?
    是的，没错。我们给商家提供商业和雇佣方面的法律建议。您为什么需要法律建议呢？

4.  事情是这样的：我有一个小生意和三个雇员，但我现在想要卖掉这个生意。这是一个很艰难的决定。
    Here is the thing: I have a small business with three employees, but I want to sell the business now. It's a tough decision.

5.  I see. I can help you with the legal aspects of selling your business, if you like. However, you will need to handle the arrangements for the employees yourself.
    我明白了。如果您愿意，我可以帮助您处理出售生意的法律事务。然而，您需要自己处理员工的安排。

6.  谢谢。我需要您帮我起草卖生意的协议。我已经找到买家了，但我的组织能力不是很好。
    Thank you. I need your help to draft the sales agreement. I have already found a buyer, but my organizational skills are not very strong.

7.  Congratulations! I can help you draft the agreement. That won't be a problem. When you need to terminate the employment contracts, I can help with that as well.
    恭喜！我可以帮助您起草合同。没问题的。您需要终止员工合同的时候，我也可以帮忙。

8.  不，员工希望继续为新买家工作。买家已经同意了，我也希望他们都能有个好去处。
    No, the employees want to continue working for the new buyer. The buyer has agreed, and I hope they all find a good place.

9.  That would be a good outcome for all of you. I will prepare a conditional sales agreement, which will also provide legal protection for the employees.
    那对你们所有人来说都会是一个很好的结果。我会起草一份附带条件的出售协议，让员工也能获得法律保护。

10. 谢谢你，这样我就放心多了。我不喜欢因为遗漏一些部分，而导致预想不到的事情发生。
    Thank you. This makes me feel much more relieved. I don't like it when unexpected things happen because of missing some parts.

11. Yes, it's always a wise decision to seek help from professionals, as drafting a sales agreement involves many considerations.
    是的，寻求专业人士的帮助总是明智的决定，因为起草出售协议涉及许多需要考虑的事项。

12. 是的，我还有很多存货和设备，也需要包含在卖生意的协议里。
    Yes, I also have a lot of inventory and equipment that need to be included in the sales agreement.

13. Why don't we schedule an appointment to organize the sales agreement? If it's urgent, I'm available at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
    我们约个时间来整理出售协议怎么样？如果事情紧急的话，我明天下午两点有空。

14. 太好了！明天见，期待见到您以及开始弄协议。
    Great! See you tomorrow. I look forward to meeting you and getting started on the agreement.

#70160. Rental Inquiry at the Council Office - Business

1.  Good morning. Welcome to the Council Office. Please tell me how I can help you today.
    早上好，欢迎来到市政厅办公室。请告诉我今天我能如何帮助您。

2.  上午好，我想要了解更多关于租房的信息。我想要住在这个地区，这里看起来是个很好的地方。
    Good morning. I would like to learn more about renting a property. I want to live in this area; it seems like a great place.

3.  Yes, it is. People love to live here. There are many shops and restaurants in this area. The parks are beautiful and very close to the beach.
    是的，这里确实如此。人们喜欢住在这里。这个地区有很多商店和餐馆，公园也很美丽，非常靠近海滩。

4.  太好了。我没想到这里的海滩这么棒，而且还这么近。我刚来到澳大利亚时间还不长。目前为止，我见到的所有海滩都很棒。
    That's great. I didn't expect the beach here to be so wonderful and so close. I've only recently arrived in Australia, and so far, all the beaches I've seen have been great.

5.  Welcome to Australia. I believe it would be challenging to move to a new country, as many things are quite different.
    欢迎来到澳大利亚。我相信搬到一个新国家会很有挑战，因为许多事情都很不同。

6.  是的，确实如此。很多事情都非常不同。如果能找到一个好的住所这会非常有帮助。如果可能的话，我想要注册一个房子或者公寓。
    Yes, indeed. Many things are very different. It would be very helpful to find a good place to live. If possible, I would like to register for a house or an apartment.

7.  I'm not sure if I understand what you mean by registering for a house or an apartment.
    我不太明白您所说的"注册房屋或公寓"是什么意思。

8.  在我原来的地方，市政办公室负责帮助我们注册房屋，把我们加入申请房屋的等待名单中。
    In my previous place, the Council Office was responsible for helping us register for housing and adding us to the waiting list for a property.

9.  I see. That's totally different here. In general, the Council can't provide rental properties and can't help people rent properties.
    我明白了。这在这里完全不同。通常情况下，市政办公室不能提供租赁房产，也不能帮助人们租房。

10. 哦，原来是这样。我不确定我现在能做些什么。我从来没有租过房子。
    Oh, I see. I'm not sure what I can do now; I have never rented a property before.

11. Real estate agencies manage rental properties. You could start by talking with them to find a suitable property.
    房地产中介负责管理租赁房产。你可以从跟他们谈谈开始，寻找合适的房子。

12. 我在来的路上，看到了两家房屋中介。原来他们是负责这种工作的啊。
    I saw two real estate agencies on my way here. It turns out that they are responsible for this kind of work.

13. There are reviews of agents online. You could have a look, too.
    网上有对中介的评价，你也可以看看。

14. 谢谢你的帮助。非常感谢你给我介绍了处理这件事的方法。我期待成为这个社区的一员。
    Thank you for your help. Thank you very much for explaining how to deal with this matter. I look forward to becoming a part of this community.

#70159. A Lonely Transfer Student - Education

1.  Hi, thank you for coming to see me. I understand you want to talk about your daughter at her new school, right?
    你好，谢谢你来见我。我知道你想谈谈你女儿在新学校的情况，对吗？

2.  很高兴您给我打电话。我一直想约您见面谈这件事。
    I'm glad you called me. I've been wanting to meet with you to discuss this.

3.  I know you changed a school for your daughter. That's good for her. But it sounds like she has some new problems.
    我知道你给你女儿换了学校，这对她来说是件好事。不过听起来她似乎遇到了一些新问题。

4.  是的，转学之后她的成绩提高了不少。但是在社交方面有些困难。她没交到什么朋友。
    Yes, her grades have improved a lot since the transfer. But she's having some trouble socially. She hasn't made any friends.

5.  It's good that her marks improved. That's a positive sign. She may just need more time to settle in and make friends.
    她的成绩有提高，这是个好兆头。她可能只是需要更多时间来适应和交朋友。

6.  可能吧。我有点担心她。她不怎么说话，但是我觉得她很孤独。我不想她的成绩再下降。
    Maybe. I'm a bit worried about her. She doesn't talk much, but I think she's feeling lonely. I don't want her grades to drop again.

7.  Maybe some after-school activities will help. Is she interested in anything?
    也许一些课外活动会有所帮助。她对什么感兴趣吗？

8.  她以前参加团体运动，但是后来，她之前的学校发生了霸凌事件，她就放弃了。她还挺擅长运动的。
    She used to participate in team sports, but she quit after a bullying incident at her old school. She's quite good at sports.

9.  Team sports can be a good opportunity to get to know more classmates. Does the school have any teams?
    团体运动是认识更多同学的好机会。学校有什么校队吗？

10. 有。我想应该有篮球队和足球队。她在以前的学校经常踢足球。
    Yes. I think they have a basketball and a football team. She used to play football a lot at her previous school.

11. That's great! She should be able to join without any problems if she played football before.
    太好了！如果她以前踢过足球，加入应该没问题的。

12. 她马上放学回家了。我会和她聊一聊，让她去试一下。
    She's coming home from school soon. I'll talk to her and encourage her to give it a try.

13. Encourage her to try. It's something extra for her to do. I think it may help.
    鼓励她试一试吧。这给她增加了一些额外的事情去做。我觉得这可能会有帮助。

14. 同意。之前我不知道能为她做些什么。但是和您交流感觉很有帮助。谢谢您。
    I agree. I didn't know what I could do for her before but talking with you has been very helpful. Thank you.

#70158. Catering Business Ideas - Business

1.  Hello, I haven't seen you since you finished your business course. What a nice coincidence to see you here!
    你好，你上完商业课程以后，我就没见过你了。真巧在这里遇到你。

2.  你好。是啊。我每天在这里为我的生意采购新鲜食材。我也很高兴见到你。
    Hello. Yes, I come here every day to buy fresh ingredients for my business. I'm also very happy to see you.

3.  I'm really glad to see that you have your own business. How's your business going?
    很开心你有了自己的生意。你的生意怎么样了？

4.  最近很好。我刚刚搬到一个大一点的场地，在一个大商场旁边。我需要一个更大的场地。
    It's been going well recently. I just moved to a bigger place, next to a large shopping mall. I needed more space.

5.  That's exciting! I want to hear more about it. Do you have time to sit and talk with me?
    那很让人激动啊。我想多了解了解。你有时间坐下来跟我聊聊吗？

6.  有。在我开始工作之前还有几分钟时间。我也想和你聊聊生意上的事。
    Yes, I have a few minutes before I start work. I'd also like to talk to you about business matters.

7.  Good. I'm happy to help if I can. Do you need any advice on business ideas?
    很好。如果我能帮到你的话，我很开心。你需要一些关于商业点子的建议吗？

8.  嗯。现在我接到更多晚宴订单。我有个想法，我可以为其他文化做传统美食。
    Yes. I'm getting more orders for dinner events. I have an idea to make traditional dishes for other cultures.

9.  Do you know what culture you want to cook for? You may need to create a list of recipes and ingredients.
    你知道你想做哪种文化的菜吗？你可能需要准备一个菜谱和食材清单。

10. 是啊，不过那会很有趣。我不确定是哪种文化。我需要发掘。
    Yes, but it would be fun. I'm not sure which culture it will be yet. I need to explore that.

11. A survey of your customers might help. You don't want to serve food your customers aren't interested in.
    对你的客户进行调研可能会有帮助。你也不想提供他们不感兴趣的食物。

12. 有道理。我需要考虑一下再决定。做事情没必要匆匆忙忙的。
    That makes sense. I need to think it through before deciding. There's no need to rush.

13. You're in a good position. You're doing well, and you have time to think about the next step. Now you need to work.
    你现在的情况很棒。你做得很好，而且有时间考虑下一步。现在你需要去工作啦。

14. 是的。我没时间了，不过我很高兴和你谈话。感谢你倾听我的想法。
    Yes. I'm running out of time, but it's been great talking with you. Thank you for hearing my thoughts.
