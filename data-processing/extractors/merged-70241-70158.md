#70241. Suite Bathroom Design Clarification - Business

1.
Hey, the office mentioned you'd drop by to visit the site again today. I bet you'll be pleased with the progress.
嗨，办公室那边说你今天要再来工地一趟。我相信你会对进度满意的。

2.
对啊，我就在附近上班，顺路过来看看挺方便的。看着新房子一点点盖起来，我超激动的。
Yeah, I work nearby so it's easy to swing by. I'm thrilled watching my new house take shape.

3.
The crew has now finished the walls, floors, and doors. The supplier has finally delivered the materials early last week.
施工队现在已经做完墙壁、地板和门了。上周早些时候，供应商总算把材料送到了。

4.
速度真快！因为材料送过来的时间延期了，我本来还以为需要更长的时间呢。现在材料好像都很难买，运输也很慢。
That was quick! Since the material delivery was delayed, I thought it would take longer. Nowadays it seems really hard to get materials, and shipping is so slow too.

5.
True, and material prices have gone up too. Since you're here, I'd like to go over the plans with you.
没错，材料现在也涨价了。既然你来了，我想和你一起过一下图纸。

6.
没问题。我感觉我每天晚上回家都会看施工图纸。所以每个房间具体会是什么样子的，我都清清楚楚。
No problem. I feel like I check the construction plans every night when I get home. So, I know exactly what each room will look like.

7.
The plumber's working on the suite bathroom now. I just want to double-check you haven't changed the plan for it.
现在水管工在弄套房的浴室。我只是想再次确认一下你没有改那一块的图纸。

8.
我没改。我希望没有什么问题。我那个套间的浴室是围绕着一个精美的老式浴缸而设计的。
No changes. I hope there won't be any issues. The bathroom in my suite is designed around a beautiful vintage bathtub.

9.
I'll need to speak with him. He was going to include a shower in the bathroom. But he hasn't started yet. There shouldn't be any problems.
我得跟他聊聊。他打算在浴室加个淋浴。不过他还没开始弄呢。应该没问题。

10.
我很喜欢泡澡，所以我绝对不想在套间的浴室装淋浴。我们的主浴室已有一个淋浴间了。
I really enjoy soaking in the bath, so I absolutely don't want a shower in my suite bathroom. Our master bathroom already has a shower.

11.
It struck me as a bit strange this morning. That's why I inspect the site every day.
我今早上看着就突然觉得有点怪，这也是为什么我每天都要到工地检查的原因。

12.
太感谢了，让我放心多了。你这么快就能发现和解决问题，真的太棒了。
Thanks so much. That really puts my mind at ease. It's so great you can catch and fix issues promptly.

13.
Of course. I believe in looking after my customers, and I know how important it is to keep track of everything.
当然。我是客户至上的，而且我也知道每件事都把控好有多重要。

14.
设计这个房子有这么多的事情要做呀！我不知道盖一个房子需要这么复杂。
There are so many things to do when designing this house! I had no idea building a house could be this complicated.

#70240. A New Creamy Leather Lounge Chair - Business

1.
Hey, great to see you! We've finally got a chance to catch up.
嘿，好高兴见到你！我们终于有机会聚一聚了。

2.
对啊，咱们好久没坐下来慢慢喝咖啡聊聊天了。
Yeah, it's been ages since we last sat down to enjoy coffee and chat.

3.
How's your day going? You mentioned you were browsing the mall before coming here to meet me.
你今天过得怎么样？你说你来这跟我见面之前还在逛商场呢。

4.
对，我就是想买把新休闲椅，所以一直在商场里逛，想挑个质感好的。
Yeah, I just want to buy a new lounge chair, so I've been looking around the mall for one that feels really nice.

5.
That's awesome. Big stores have loads of options. But furniture can be expensive, depending on what you want.
那太好了。大商场的选择多得很。不过家具可不便宜啊，这要看你想要什么样的了。

6.
我看上了一款奶油色皮质沙发，很对我胃口，可价格不算低。我不太确定最划算的付款方式是怎样的。
I spotted a cream-colored leather sofa that I really like, but it isn't cheap. I'm not sure which payment method makes the most sense.

7.
You could go with one of those 'Buy Now, Pay Later' services. Nowadays almost every store offers them.
你可以选择那种'先买后付'服务，现在几乎所有店都有这种选项。

8.
要是可以分次付款，就太棒了。这样的话，我就能立刻把皮沙发搬回家了。
It'd be great to split the payment, then I could take the leather sofa home right away.

9.
True, but watch out for extra fees, and skipping an installment payment could affect your credit score.
没错，不过要留意额外费用，漏交一笔分期付款还可能影响你的信用记录。

10.
我知道对于这种'先买后付'要谨慎点，可是感觉挺适合我的。毕竟，我只买这一件东西。
I get that 'Buy Now, Pay Later' needs caution, but I feel it might work well for me. After all, I'm only buying this one thing.

11.
It's smart to think about your best payment options for big purchases. You could save money or make it easier to pay.
考虑一下大额消费的最佳付款方式是明智的。你可能可以省钱，或者让付款更轻松。

12.
我也这么觉得。我今晚好好比对一下，再明天去店里决定。我觉得这沙发放客厅肯定很棒。
I agree. I'll carefully compare them tonight and decide at the store tomorrow. I bet that sofa would look fantastic in the living room.

13.
Creamy leather sounds a perfect choice. How about we grab a slice of cake with our coffee to celebrate?
奶油色的皮革，这选择听着太完美了。要不咱俩喝咖啡时再加块蛋糕，庆祝一下？

14.
听起来很完美。我逛完这一圈，肚子都饿扁了。希望一切都顺利。
Sounds perfect. I'm starving after all that shopping. Hope it all works out.

#70239. Light-Filled Home Office Plans - Business

1.
Hi, it's great to see you. It feels like ages since our last chat. Have you been away or just super busy? How have you been keeping?
嗨，见到你真高兴。感觉上次聊天过去好久了。你最近是出门了，还是单纯特别忙？最近怎么样啊？

2.
是啊，有一段时间了。最近一直在装修我的房子，现在终于完工了。整个过程很累，但是值得。
Yeah, it's been a while. I've been renovating my house, and it's finally done now. The entire process is tiring but it is totally worth it.

3.
Great! I remember seeing your plans! It was a massive job. Really glad it went smoothly for you. The final result must be so satisfying!
太好了！我记得看过你的设计图，工程特别大。真高兴你一切顺利。最后效果一定很满意吧！

4.
一切都很顺利。幸运的是，我们找到了一个靠谱的建筑商。大工程完成了，装饰是更有趣的部分。
Everything went well. Luckily, we found a reliable builder. The major work is done, and the decorating part is more fun!

5.
True, it must be overwhelming with all those decisions. Picking finishes takes real patience!
是啊，做这么多决定肯定很头疼。选装修材料可得有耐心！

6.
我们一次只装修一个房间，这样就更容易管理。而且不用赶时间，我们可以慢慢琢磨。
We're doing one room at a time to keep it more manageable. No rush. We can take our time to think things through.

7.
That's smart. Taking your time ensures the house turns out just right. Which room are you tackling now?
这法子聪明。慢慢来才能把房子装出理想效果。你们现在弄哪个房间？

8.
我们在装修时，弄了个大阁楼。现在准备把它做成家庭办公室，那里的自然光线特别好。
During the renovation, we added a spacious loft. Now we plan to turn it into a home office. The natural light there is perfect!

9.
Those massive windows must give amazing natural light! Perfect for an office. Have you picked out a desk yet?
大窗户，采光肯定超棒！做办公室绝了。桌子选好了吗？

10.
家具全用素净的颜色，不选深色桌子。另外我还打算装百叶窗。
All furniture is in neutral colours, no dark desks. Plus, I plan to add blinds.

11.
Good call! Making sure you are happy with it for years is important! You don't want to redecorate again too soon.
明智的选择！确保这个装修能让你喜欢很多年是很重要的，谁都不想太快重新装修一遍。

12.
我同意你说的。所以，我们会用简单素净的设计，然后用小地毯这种容易换的小东西来增加一些鲜艳的色彩。
I agree. That's why we'll go for simple and neutral designs and add some bright colors with easy-to-swap items like rugs.

13.
Love that idea! Seriously can't wait to see it finished. You must send me photos! I bet it's going to look fantastic!
这主意好！真是都等不及想看成果了！你一定得发照片给我！我觉得肯定会超级好看！

14.
我也等不及请你来参观了！不过，还得等一阵子，收尾工作比预想耗时。我也不想太赶了。
Can't wait to show you either! Still need some time though – the finishing touches are taking longer than expected. I don't want to rush it either.

#70238. Ordering Oat Milk in a Small Town - Business

1.
Hi, it's nice to see you. I hope you've settled in! Living in a small town must be a big change. Have you gotten used to the quieter pace yet?
嗨，很高兴见到你。希望你已经安顿好了！住在这么小的镇上肯定是大变化。你适应了这种更悠闲的节奏了吗？

2.
你好！是的，我从来没住过这么小的地方，而且这儿离城里又很远。不过邻居们都特别热情。
Hello, yes, I've never lived in such a small place, and it's quite a distance from the city. But the neighbours have been really welcoming.

3.
It is. It takes a while to get to the city and a while to get used to everything here. I hope the sense of community can make up for it.
确实，去城里要花点时间，这里的生活节奏也要慢慢适应。我希望这里的社区氛围能弥补这些不便。

4.
对，我发现小镇上的人都很友好，我通过工作，已经认识了大半个镇上的人。这种亲切感在大城市里可体验不到。
Yes, I've found that people in this town are very friendly, and through work I've already met most of them. You'd never get that kind of warmth in a big city!

5.
Everyone got excited when the new doctor arrived. The previous doctor moved back to the city, and it took a long time before the replacement showed up.
新的医生一来大家都很兴奋。之前的医生搬回城里，换医生又等了好一阵子。

6.
我现在不打算搬回城里，但是，我确实很想念城里的东西，尤其是那些商店。想买什么都能在一个商场里搞定。
I'm not planning to move back to the city, but I do miss city amenities, especially those shops. You could get everything in one shopping centre.

7.
I understand. I can order some grocery items for you from my suppliers if they're things you buy regularly but we don't have them in stock.
我明白。如果你经常买的日用品我们没有库存，我可以帮你从我供应商那里订购。

8.
太好了，我都不知道你可以这样做，我有过敏，所以我更喜欢喝燕麦奶。但是现在快喝完了。
Great, I didn't realize you could do that. I have allergies, so I prefer oat milk. But mine's almost gone.

9.
Okay, most people in this town buy dairy or soy milk, so I have them in stock. But I think I can order oat milk for you from my supplier.
好的，这里大多数人喝乳制品或豆奶，所以这些都有货。不过我想我可以从我供应商那里给你订燕麦奶。

10.
太好了。如果可以的话，我一周需要消耗两升燕麦奶。我通常会每两周购买一次。
Great. If possible, I use about two litres of oat milk per week. I usually buy it every two weeks.

11.
That should be fine. I restock every one to two weeks, so I'll make sure to order enough. I'll see if I can have your oat milk delivered along with my other goods.
应该没问题。我每一到两周补货一次，所以我会确保订够量的。我会看看能不能把你的燕麦奶和我的其他货一起送来。

12.
太感谢了，真的谢谢你。说不定你订了燕麦奶以后，镇上其他人也会跟着买呢。
Thanks so much, I really appreciate it. If you order oat milk, maybe other people in the town will buy it too.

13.
You never know. I'm happy to help. If you order yourself, the delivery fee will be very high, but I can get it cheaper for you.
谁知道呢。我很乐意帮忙。如果你自己下单，运费会很贵，但我可以帮你拿到更便宜的价格。

14.
感谢你！我发现，小镇上的人们都很团结互助，这是住在这里最美好的事情之一。
Thank you! I've found that people in this town really stick together. This is one of the best things about living here.

#70237. New Immigrant's Banking Adjustment - Business

1.
Hi there! Thanks for calling our bank. We're here to make your banking experience as smooth as possible. What can I do for you today?
你好！感谢致电我们银行。我们致力于让您的银行业务体验更加顺畅。今天有什么可以为您效劳的吗？

2.
我刚移民到澳大利亚不久，在你们银行开了户。现在碰到些问题，想跟您咨询下。毕竟，这边的流程和国内不太一样。
I recently migrated to Australia and opened an account with your bank. Now I've run into some issues, and I'd like to ask you. The process here is different from back home.

3.
Absolutely! Ask me anything about your bank account! I'm here to help. Banking systems do vary between countries, so it's totally normal to have questions.
当然！关于银行账户的问题尽管问我！我都可以帮您解答。各国银行系统确实不同，有疑问非常正常。

4.
确实，很多事都挺陌生的。我在努力适应了，可是，我老是担心我问的问题太傻，怪不好意思的。
Yeah, lots of things feel unfamiliar here. I'm trying to adapt, but I keep worrying my questions sound silly. It's quite embarrassing.

5.
No stress at all! When you're new to something, every question matters. We're here to help you sort things out. So, what's been on your mind?
千万别有压力！刚接触新事物时，每个问题都很重要。我们就是帮您解决问题的。所以，您遇到什么情况了？

6.
我老是搞不清楚账单什么时候该付。一忙起来，就忘了缴款。跟上各种账单的缴费实在是太难了。这问题困扰我好一阵子了。
I'm always confused about when bills are due, and when I get busy, I completely forget to pay them. Keeping up with bill payments is so hard. This has been bothering me for quite a while.

7.
Why not set up automatic payment? Just authorize direct debit. Then the bills get paid on time without you lifting a finger.
您不妨开通自动扣款？您只需要授权，然后账单会按时支付，完全不用您操心。

8.
自动扣款？听上去不错。这个功能可以在我的手机银行应用里自己操作吗？还是需要您帮我激活？
Direct debit? Sounds good. Can I do this myself on my mobile banking app? Or do you need to activate it for me?

9.
Actually, you'll need to give your payment details to the company billing you. They're the ones who manage your payment collection. I can't set that up from our end.
实际上，您需要把付款信息提供给给您发账单的公司。他们负责收款。我在我们银行端操作不了这个。

10.
知道这个方法后，办银行业务会顺手很多呀。我开始习惯网上支付了。用手机付款我也越来越得心应手啦。
Got it! Knowing this method would make banking way easier. I'm getting used to online payments now. I'm getting more comfortable with mobile payments!

11.
Our mobile app actually has multiple payment methods built in. You'll find it super convenient to handle everything on your own, such as managing all your bill payments.
我们的手机应用其实内置了好几种付款方式。您完全可以自己轻松搞定所有支付操作，比如管理所有账单的支付。

12.
手机银行是挺方便，可我偶尔还是怀念去分行找柜员面对面聊的感觉。刚来这里啥都不熟悉那会儿，这种感觉特别强烈。
Mobile banking is convenient, but occasionally I still miss chatting face-to-face with a bank teller in a branch. Back when I first arrived and everything felt unfamiliar, that feeling was especially strong.

13.
Totally get that! Just know our hotline's always open! Any confusion, give us a ring right away. We've got staff ready twenty-four seven to answer any banking questions.
完全理解！记住我们热线随时畅通！有任何不清楚马上给我们打电话。我们全天候都有工作人员，帮您解答任何银行业务问题。

14.
真的太感谢您的帮助了！您让一切变得简单多了。后续，要是遇到问题，我肯定第一时间联系您。说真的，今天您的耐心让我特别感激！
Thanks a ton for your help! You've made everything so much easier. If anything comes up later, I'll contact you first. Seriously, I really appreciate your patience today!

#70236. Shed to Park: Planting Volunteers - Social

1.
Hey there, come on in! I heard you were asking about volunteering opportunities. We'd love to tell you more about how you can get involved.
你好，快请进！我听说你在打听志愿者机会。我们很乐意多给你讲讲怎么参与。

2.
对的，我刚搬来一个月左右。想找点事儿做，好尽快熟悉这一片儿。毕竟新地方嘛，多认识点邻居挺好的。
Yep, I just moved here about a month ago. Trying to find things to do to get to know the area sooner. After all, it's a new place and it's nice to meet more neighbors.

3.
We're always looking for people to help out with our activities. Honestly, volunteers help everything we do here. We really couldn't manage without them!
我们一直在找人给活动帮忙。说真的，我们所有工作都有志愿者帮忙。没有他们真忙不过来。

4.
我在家办公，所以时间安排挺自由的。每周都能抽出几个小时帮忙。说实话，我主要想多认识些人。
I work from home, so my schedule's pretty flexible. I can spare a few hours every week to volunteer. Honestly, I mainly want to meet more new people.

5.
Absolutely! Lots of our volunteers end up becoming friends. Is there anything specific you enjoy doing? We'll try to match you with a project that suits your hobbies.
当然！很多志愿者最后都成了朋友。你有什么特别喜欢做的吗？我们会尽量按你的兴趣匹配项目。

6.
我什么都愿意试试，不过我确实特别喜欢园艺，还有种植。最近，我还在家搞了个小菜园呢。
I'm open to anything, but I'm indeed into gardening and planting stuff. I've been working on a little veggie garden at home lately.

7.
That's perfect! We actually have an ideal project. We're fixing up that park next to the mall. Your skills would be a great fit there.
真好！实际上我们有个项目很合适。我们在修缮商场旁边那个公园。你的特长在那儿完全能用上。

8.
我都不知道那儿有个公园呢，一直以为就是块空地。这消息还挺让人惊喜的！
I had no idea there was a park there – I always thought it was just an empty lot. That's really nice to hear!

9.
Right now, we need helpers to look after the seedlings in our shed before planting them in the park. When they're strong enough, they'll be moved to the park.
现在，我们需要帮手在我们的棚子里照看那些树苗，之后再把它们种到公园里。等它们长得足够结实了，就挪到公园里去。

10.
这事儿我能行！种本地植物，我特别乐意帮忙。而且我能看出这个公园修缮后一定会很漂亮。
I can totally do this! Planting native plants—I'd be really happy to help. And I can tell this park will look so nice once it's fixed up.

11.
It's a big project for sure, but it'll be worth it when we see the results. We'll also be installing some benches so people can relax there.
工程肯定不小，但看到成果就值了。我们还会装些长椅，方便大家休息。

12.
公园对咱们社区居民可重要了。大伙儿总得有个地方散步，或者单纯坐着透透气吧。
Parks are quite important to people in our community. Everyone needs a spot to take walks or just sit and get some fresh air.

13.
Definitely! We got really lucky to have raised lots of community donations to restore the park. The whole neighborhood's keen to see it open again.
没错！这次公园改造能筹到很多社区捐款，真是太幸运了。整个社区都盼着看到它重新开放呢。

14.
能帮着重建公园，我特别开心。感觉这个项目特别有意义，让每个人都很有成就感。
Being able to help rebuild the park makes me really happy. I feel this project is really meaningful — it gives everyone a sense of accomplishment.

#70235. Late Fee and Direct Debit - Business

1.
Hi! Thank you for calling our bank. My name is Dylan from Customer Support. Please be aware that this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes.
您好！感谢致电我们银行。我是客户支持的迪伦。请注意，为保证服务质量和培训目的，您的通话可能会被录音。

2.
早上好。我刚收到一张账单，上面说我欠了"滞纳金"。我明明记得付过钱了！这到底是怎么回事？
Good morning. I just received a bill saying I owe a "late payment fee". I'm sure I paid it! What's exactly going on?

3.
I understand that can be frustrating. Let me check your account history for that biller. To help me, could you tell me how you made the payment?
我理解这很令人沮丧。让我查一下您对该收款方的账户记录。方便告诉我您是怎么付款的吗？

4.
我是用你们手机银行的应用付的。真怀念能去银行分行当面跟柜员聊聊啊，这样我直接拿手机给柜员看就行了。
I paid it using your bank's app. I really miss being able to just go into a branch and talk to a clerk face-to-face. Then I could just show them what's on my phone.

5.
Don't worry. Looking at the dates, it seems you paid on the due date. For some billers, the payment might not be processed until the next business day.
别担心。看日期，您好像是在到期日当天付的款。对一些收款方来说，款项可能要到下一个工作日才处理。

6.
我当天付了钱，只是处理晚了，收款方没在截止时间前收到。现在我就得付那个滞纳金？这太不合理了！
I paid on the day. It was just that the processing was late, and the biller didn't receive it before the deadline. Now I have to pay that late fee? That seems unfair!

7.
Unfortunately, that's correct according to the biller's terms. To avoid this in the future, I strongly recommend setting up a direct debit.
很遗憾，根据收款方的条款，确实如此。为了避免将来再发生这种情况，我强烈建议您设置直接扣款。

8.
直接扣款？意思是，钱自动从我的账户划走？这样安全吗？万一金额错了，怎么办？
Direct debit? Meaning the money is taken out of my account automatically? Is that safe? What if the amount is wrong?

9.
With direct debit, you authorise the biller to take the payment directly from your account. It's very secure and ensures you never miss a payment.
使用直接扣款，您授权收款方直接从您的账户扣款。这非常安全，确保您永远不会错过付款。

10.
听起来不错。那不能设置直接扣款的账单呢？比如，我的网费账单好像就不行。我还有其他选择吗？
That sounds good. What about those bills that can't be set up for direct debit? Like my internet bill, I don't think it lets me set that up. Do I have other options?

11.
You can use BPAY. It's a very common way to pay bills in Australia through online banking or our app. You'll find the unique biller code on your bill.
您可以使用账单支付服务。这是在澳大利亚通过网上银行或我们的应用来支付账单的常用方式。您可以在账单上找到唯一的收款方代码。

12.
明白了。那我下次最好提前几天付款，或者用直接扣款或账单支付服务，对吧？这样就不会再有滞纳金了。
Got it. So next time, I should pay a few days early, or use direct debit or BPAY, right? Then there won't be any more late fees.

13.
That's exactly right! You can find guides for both methods on our website or in our app. Would you like me to email you the links?
完全正确！您可以在我们网站上或应用里找到这两种方法的指南。需要我把链接发邮件给您吗？

14.
请发给我吧！谢谢你一切都解释得这么清楚。我现在知道该怎么避免滞纳金了。这样一来，办理银行业务就方便多了。
Please send them! Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I know how to avoid late fees now. This makes banking much more convenient.

#70234. Small Town Doctor & Grocer - Social

1.
Hello! Good to see you. It was a relief when you arrived after the previous doctor decided to move back to the city. We were worried about being without a doctor for too long.
你好！很高兴见到你。之前的医生决定搬回城里后，你能来真让我们松了口气。我们之前还担心会很久没有医生呢。

2.
谢谢！我很高兴能有机会接手这个诊所，为大家服务。虽然说，小镇的生活和我以前习惯的生活很不一样。
Thank you! I'm very happy to have the opportunity to take over this clinic and serve everyone. Although life in this small town is quite different from what I was used to before.

3.
We are really grateful that you came. Having a doctor right here who knows us makes all the difference, especially for the little check-ups and advice.
我们真的很感激你能来。身边有个了解我们的医生太重要了，特别是日常检查和小毛病咨询。

4.
这半年多来，我也在努力熟悉每一位病人和他们的健康情况。这种紧密的联系，在大城市的医院里，是很难建立的。
Over the past six months or so, I've been working hard to get to know each patient and their health situation. This kind of close connection is hard to establish in big city hospitals.

5.
We're lucky to have you. So, apart from the medical side, how are you finding life here overall? Anything you miss?
我们有你很幸运。那么，除了医疗工作，你觉得这里的生活怎么样？有什么想念的东西吗？

6.
整体上，我很喜欢这里的安静和友善。不过，日常生活里的一些小习惯，比如一些吃的喝的，这里的选择就少多了。
Overall, I really like the peacefulness and friendliness here. However, for some small daily habits, like certain food and drinks, the choices here are much more limited.

7.
That's where my little shop comes in! If there's something specific you need regularly that we don't stock, just tell me. I can usually get them through my suppliers.
这就是我的小店发挥作用的地方了！如果有什么你常用的，但我们店里没有的东西，直接告诉我一声。我通常能通过供应商拿到货。

8.
太好了，我们刚搬来时，买了几罐茉莉花茶和几瓶辣椒酱。但是现在，快半年了，都快见底了。
Great! When we first moved here, we bought a few jars of jasmine tea and a few bottles of chili sauce. But now, after almost half a year, they're almost gone.

9.
I heard from your receptionist that you have a really nice porcelain tea set at the doctor's clinic. You must be really missing your favourite tea and that spicy kick!
我从你前台那里听说，你在诊所有套很漂亮的瓷器茶具。你肯定很想念你最喜欢的茶和那种辣味的刺激感吧！

10.
是的啊。没有茶提神醒脑，也没有辣酱开胃下饭，我感觉我一天的工作都没法干利索。
Yes, exactly. Without tea to refresh my mind and chili sauce to stimulate my appetite for meals, I feel like I can't get my day's work done properly.

11.
Consider it done. That lovely tea set deserves the perfect brew. I'll put in an order for your preferred jasmine tea and chili sauce first thing tomorrow.
包在我身上。那么漂亮的茶具就该配上好茶。我明天一早就给你订你喜欢的茉莉花茶和辣椒酱。

12.
你真是太贴心了！小镇的人也都很好！前天晚上，诊所有个小状况，镇上几位邻居马上就来帮忙了，让我特别感动。
You're so thoughtful! The people in town are really wonderful too! Just the night before last, there was a small issue at the clinic, and several neighbors came over immediately to help. It really touched me.

13.
That's just how we do things around here. Folks look out for each other, especially for someone like you who's become so important to us all.
我们这儿的人就是这样。大家互相照应，特别是对你这样对我们所有人都很重要的人。

14.
谢谢你！就是这些点点滴滴的小事，让我觉得这里不只是一个工作的地方，更像一个可以扎根的家。
Thank you! It's these little things that make me feel this place isn't just a workplace, but more like a home where I can stay for good.

#70233. Excavator Theft - Business

1.
You've reached the police non-emergency line. If it's life-threatening, hang up and dial triple zero. Otherwise, I'm here to take your report.
您已拨通警察非紧急热线。如果是人命关天的事，请挂断打000。其他情况，我可以帮您记录报案。

2.
您好，我想确认下，我没打错电话吧？我要报个案子。手机查了半天，才找到这个号码。希望您能帮上忙。
Hello, I just want to make sure if I got the right number. I need to report a crime. I searched forever on my phone for this contact. Really hope you can help me out.

3.
Yep, you're in the right place for non-urgent stuff. But if it's like a robbery in progress, we can't handle it here.
对，非紧急案件打这儿没错。但要是抢劫正在发生，我们这儿处理不了。

4.
没人受伤。不是啥暴力犯罪，可是，损失挺大的。我工地的设备没了，急死我了。
No one is hurt. Not a violent crime, but the loss is bad. My construction site equipment is gone – I'm so worried.

5.
Understood. Even a small incident can be upsetting for the person involved. Don't worry, we'll get this documented.
明白。再小的事，摊到当事人身上，也让人难受。别急，我帮您登记。

6.
保险公司卡着不赔偿我，非得先要警方案件编号。不然，谁想麻烦警察啊！
The insurance company is withholding my compensation until they get the police case number. Otherwise, who would want to trouble the police?

7.
Got it. Sounds like a theft, and your insurer needs proof. Could you walk me through exactly what happened?
明白。这听起来像是被盗，而且保险公司需要凭证。您能给我讲一遍到底发生了什么吗？

8.
我是一个建筑公司的老板。昨天晚上，我的一个经理把挖掘机忘在工地上了，结果，就被偷了。
I run a construction company. Last night, one of my managers left an excavator on the site, and it got stolen.

9.
Oh dear, how awful! Is that the big machine that digs the ground of buildings, right? I know that's an expensive machine.
天哪，真糟糕！就是那种用来挖楼房地基的大型机器吧？我知道那机器很贵。

10.
是的。它用来给楼房打地基。它非常昂贵。我们给工地上锁了，但它还是被偷了。
Yes. It's for digging foundations for buildings. It's very expensive. We locked the site, but it was still taken.

11.
This type of equipment is always a prime target for thieves. Even with locks in place, they will find a way to break in.
这种设备总是盗贼盯上的目标。即使上了锁，他们也会千方百计地进去。

12.
可不嘛！幸亏买了保险。东西找不回来，至少能拿钱。不然，公司的现金流真要崩了。
Absolutely! Fortunately, we had insurance coverage. Even if the item can't be recovered, at least we can get compensation. Otherwise, the company would face a cash flow crisis.

13.
Absolutely. Now, I'll need a few more details before I can issue you a case number. You need to tell me the model, serial number and the exact location.
没错。现在我需要再了解一些细节，才能给您一个案件编号。你要告诉我机器的型号、序列号和具体位置。

14.
太感谢了！型号和序列号我让项目经理马上发邮件给您。一拿到号码，我立马发给保险公司。
Huge thanks! My project manager will email you the model and serial number immediately. I'll send this to the insurance company the second I get the number.

#70232. Ceiling Leak Emergency Report - Business

1.
Good afternoon, this is your property manager Steven. I'm returning your call about an apartment issue. How can I help?
下午好，我是你的物业经理史蒂文。您来电反映公寓问题，我给您回电。有什么可以帮您？

2.
你好！感谢这么快回电。我是新租客。我的主卧天花板在漏水！
Hi! Thanks for calling back so soon. I'm a new tenant. My master bedroom ceiling is leaking!

3.
Welcome to the building. For repair requests, our online platform ensures faster processing, and we can also have a written record.
欢迎入住。维修请求通过在线平台处理更快，我们还能有书面记录。

4.
这次我等不及系统处理了。暴雨后，漏水越来越严重，墙皮都开始脱落了！
This can't wait. The leak got worse after the storm, and the wall paint is peeling now!

5.
Our online system prioritizes urgent cases too. Notifications will come to me straight away. Could you describe the leak location?
我们的线上系统也会优先处理紧急情况的。通知会直接发到我这边的。请描述漏水位置?

6.
就在床的正上方！就现在，水滴都直接往被子上滴呢。昨晚简直像睡在水帘洞里。
Right above the bed! Water is now dripping directly onto the quilt. It felt like I was sleeping under a waterfall last night.

7.
That's certainly unacceptable. It must have been disturbing to you. Has there been any roof renovation work done recently?
这确实不能忍。一定让你很烦吧。最近楼顶有施工吗？

8.
不知道。我才搬来五天。这漏水痕迹，明显是陈旧的水渍，都是发黄的。
I don't know. I just moved in five days ago. The water stains are clearly old and yellowed.

9.
You're right. Water damage can compromise structural safety. I'll dispatch roofers immediately.
您说得对。漏水可能危害结构安全。我马上派屋顶维修工。

10.
太好了，救了我的命。希望他们不用拆天花板。我才刚刚布置好卧室啊。
Great! That's a lifesaver. Hopefully they won't need to tear down the ceiling. I just finished decorating the bedroom.

11.
Apologies this wasn't detected during inspection. We'll try to minimize the damage and update you hourly.
很抱歉，查房时没发现这问题。我们会尽量把损坏降到最小，每小时跟你更新进展。

12.
谢谢。维修需要我清空衣帽间吗？我的衣服才刚刚按照颜色整理好啊。
Thanks. Should I empty the walk-in closet? I just sorted my clothes by colour.

13.
You just need to remove bedding temporarily. Protective covers will be used during repairs.
就暂时移开床上用品就行。施工时会铺防护罩的。

14.
好的。那我等你通知。希望快点修好，别再漏水了。谢谢你。下次再报修，我会在网上提交的。
Okay. I'll wait to hear from you. Hope the repair gets done soon and the leaking stops. Thanks. Next time I need to report a repair, I'll do it online.

#70231. Designing a Relaxing Indoor-Outdoor Space - Business

1.
Hey there! It's been ages since we chatted last. I was just thinking about you the other day and wondering how things have been going on your end.
嗨！咱好久没聊天了。我前几天还在想你，想着你这边最近怎么样呀。

2.
是啊，好久不见了。我这段时间一直在翻新后院花园。现在终于大功告成，花草都种好了。
Yeah, it's been a while. I've been renovating my backyard garden recently. It's finally done, and the plants are all in place.

3.
That sounds awesome! Your garden redesign looked like a huge project. I hope it all turned out just the way you wanted.
听起来太棒了！你重新设计的花园看着真是个大工程。希望一切都按你想的那样完成了。

4.
挺顺利的。还好，我请的园艺团队很专业，帮我打理得很用心。现在，我在挑选户外家具。
It went really smoothly. Thankfully, the gardening team I hired was very professional and thorough. Now I'm picking out outdoor furniture.

5.
Picking the right plants and ornaments can get overwhelming. There are so many styles and colours to decide on.
选合适的植物和装饰品确实很累。风格和颜色有太多选择了。

6.
没错，我是先从花园的一角开始的。慢慢来，不用赶进度。我想让每个部分都很满意。
Exactly, I started with one corner of the garden. No rush—taking it slow. I want each section to be just right.

7.
Taking it step by step is smart. It gives you room to tweak things. Which corner of the garden are you focused on today?
一步一步来很明智。能让你有空去调细节。今天你在弄花园的哪个角落？

8.
我在设计让客厅可以通到外面新铺的露台，这样空间就比之前大多了。
I'm designing it so that the living room opens out to the newly built patio outside. In this case, the space is much bigger than before.

9.
Fantastic. In warm weather, you'll love the indoor-outdoor flow. Do you need more furniture to fill the extra room?
太棒了。天儿暖和的时候你会很喜欢那种里外贯通的感觉。你打算再添些家具来填补多出来的空间吗？

10.
是的，我们想放张户外沙发和几把躺椅，还打算在露台上放几件防水的家具。
Yes, we're planning to add an outdoor sofa and a few lounge chairs, and we're also thinking of adding some waterproof furniture to the deck.

11.
It's crucial that you'll love it for years to come. After all, you don't want to redecorate it again too soon.
关键是得弄完以后能喜欢很多年，毕竟不想没过多久就重装一次。

12.
我会选素净的灰色和棕色。然后用彩色抱枕、花盆来增添亮点，随时可以调整。
I'll pick neutral grey and brown colours. Then I'll add pops of colour with bright throw pillows and flowerpots. Easy to switch up anytime.

13.
I love that plan! Neutral bases with pops of colour are timeless. I'm really looking forward to checking it out when you're done.
我喜欢这个方案！素色底配亮色点缀永不过时。真期待等你完工后去参观。

14.
我也迫不及待想带你参观啦。不过还得等我把灯光和小配饰都摆好，大概要过两周。
I can't wait to show you around either. But I still need to set up the lighting and small decorations, so it'll probably be another couple of weeks.

#70230. Support for Aging Parents - Business

1.
Good morning! I haven't run into you much lately. I heard you've been on the go from morning till night. How have you been doing?
早上好！最近都不怎么碰到你，听说你最近从早到晚都很忙。你最近还好吗？

2.
谢谢你的关心！最近我常常去看我妈妈，她腿疼，身体还不太舒服。所以，我总要抽时间过去。
Thanks for asking! Recently, I've been visiting my mother a lot. She's been having leg pain and isn't feeling well, so I've been making time to see her.

3.
I remember you said your mother has joint issues. The round trip must take hours. I can imagine how tough this is for you.
我记得你说过你妈妈有关节问题。来回一趟得好几个小时吧？我能想象这对你来说得有多辛苦。

4.
是呀，我母亲不喜欢热闹，所以住在郊外。来回要开车2个小时。我基本就没什么空余时间了。
Yeah, my mom prefers quiet places, so she lives in the suburbs. It's a two-hour drive each way. I barely have any free time left.

5.
Maybe you could speak with a social worker. They might be able to check on your mother sometimes. They've helped people in similar situations.
或许你可以跟社工聊聊，说不定他们可以偶尔去看看你妈妈。他们以前也帮过跟你情况类似的人。

6.
那太好了，我之前还不知道有这种服务可以用呢。那我该联系谁呢？我得赶紧弄清楚。
That would be great. I didn't even know that kind of service was available. Who should I talk to? I'd better look into it immediately.

7.
My friend got some government payments last year. You could try contacting the same office. Also, there are social worker directories available.
我有个朋友去年也领过政府的一些补助。你可以试着找同一个部门问问。另外，还有社工名录。

8.
我自己没领过什么政府福利，我会试试的。社工名录听上去也很有帮助。
I've never received any government benefits myself. I'd like to give it a try. The social worker directory sounds really helpful too.

9.
It's important to find someone with qualifications. Even if they can't help you directly, they'll know who can.
找到有资质的人很重要。就算他们不能直接帮你，他们也一定知道谁可以帮你。

10.
这些信息对我太有用了。我其实还有不少父母养老的问题，希望他们愿意帮忙。
This info is super helpful. I've actually got a lot of questions about caring for aging parents. I hope they'll be willing to help.

11.
You're such a devoted child. It's always difficult when parents get older. They do need more care.
你很孝顺。父母年纪大了，总是件难事。他们需要的照顾更多。

12.
我想请社工帮妈妈做家庭安全评估，比如安装扶手和防滑垫。这样她在家里会更安全。
I'd like to ask a social worker to help my mother with a home safety assessment, like installing handrails and non-slip mats. That way she'll be safer in her place.

13.
Lots of community centers host a weekly free lunch for seniors. Your mother might enjoy the company.
许多社区中心每周都会为老年人提供免费午餐。你妈妈可能会喜欢有人一起陪伴。

14.
这真是个好主意！我妈妈很喜欢有人陪她一起吃饭。我马上联系他们。非常感谢你的帮助！
That's a great idea! My mother enjoys having someone eat with her. I'll get in touch with them right away. Thank you very much for your help!

#70229. Getting Insured After Moving Out - Business

1.
Hello! Welcome to our insurance company. I'm here to assist you with anything you need regarding insurance. So, what brings you in?
你好！欢迎来我们保险公司。您的所有保险需求，我都能帮到你。那么，您今天是来咨询什么的？

2.
您好，我最近刚开始了第一份工作，也正准备搬去我自己的公寓。我有一些保险方面的事情想请教您。
Hi there. I just started my first job, and I'm also about to move into my own apartment. I've got a few questions about insurance.

3.
Of course, I'd be happy to assist. Congrats on both your new job and your apartment! That's quite a few big life changes all at once.
当然，很高兴帮你。恭喜你找到工作、搬进新公寓。这一下子人生变化可真不少啊！

4.
对，是挺大的变化，但我真的很激动。我终于可以开始独立生活了，不用再住在爸妈那儿了。
Yeah, it's a big shift, but I'm really excited. I'm finally starting to live on my own and I don't need to live with my parents anymore.

5.
Hope everything goes well for you. So, what would you like to ask about insurance? It's great that you're already thinking ahead.
祝你一切顺利。那你想了解保险方面的哪些内容？你能提前考虑这些，真的很不错。

6.
我知道，我需要给自己的车和个人物品上保险。我想了解一下，怎样才能买到性价比最高的那种保险。
I know I need to get insurance for my car and my belongings. I'd like to know how to get the most cost-effective insurance.

7.
I totally get that. Insurance can be pricey, so it's important to choose the right level of cover so you're not overpaying.
我完全理解。买保险确实不便宜，关键是得买到适合自己的保障，不至于多花钱。

8.
没错。我得想想，哪些东西是必须投保的。另外，还有别的方式，能让我每个月要交的保费少一些吗？
Exactly. I need to figure out what I should insure. Also, are there any other ways to lower my monthly premium?

9.
Paying yearly instead of monthly can save money. But I get that you're just starting out, so it might be difficult to pay a lump sum.
如果一次付一年的费用，通常会比按月付款省钱。不过，我知道你刚起步，所以一次付清可能会有点吃力。

10.
这听起来蛮划算的。我手头是有点积蓄的，一年付一次，可能其实还更省事了。
That sounds like a good deal. I've saved up a bit, so paying annually might actually be easier for me.

11.
That's right. We do give a discount for annual payments because it means less time and lower administration costs. It's definitely something to think about.
确实是这样。我们对年付用户确实会提供折扣，因为那样能节省时间和管理成本。确实挺值得考虑的。

12.
我觉得，这对我来说是个正确的选择。我父母也担心我会选最低的保险，导致没有足够的保障。
I think this is the right option for me. My parents are also worried I might go for the lowest coverage and end up without enough coverage.

13.
Underinsurance can be a problem. You need to make sure it has enough coverage. If you'd like, I can send you our product information sheet.
保额不足确实是个问题。你要确保保障够用。如果你愿意，我可以把我们的产品说明单发给你。

14.
好的，太感谢你了。这听起来真的很有帮助。我回去以后，会认真研究一下资料，再给你打电话要报价。
Sure, thank you so much. That sounds really helpful. After I'm home, I'll go over the info carefully and call you back for a quote.

我们确实对公司文化和员工关怀很自豪，希望你在这工作会有成就感。

6.
我相信一定会的。我以前没在这么大规模的公司工作。我听说这里有完善的入职培训。
I'm sure I will. I've never worked at such a large company before. I heard that you have thorough onboarding training.

7.
Exactly! It helps newcomers settle in smoothly. We walk you through everything from day one, starting with basic training.
没错！这样新人能顺利适应。我们从第一天就手把手指导，从基础培训开始。

8.
真好。你们有指导手册可以帮我更快融入吗？还有，放我进来的保安说，我得有一个员工证。
That's great! Do you have a guidebook to help me settle in faster? Also, the security guard who let me in said I need a staff ID card.

9.
Yes, you'll need it for building entry and elevator access. We'll take your photo and print the card right away. Then I'll introduce you to your mentor.
是的，你得用它进大楼和用电梯。我们会马上给你拍照做卡，然后我会带您去见您的导师。

10.
还有导师吗？真好！照片的话，希望不会太难看，我一向不太喜欢拍证件照。
And I even have a mentor? That's amazing! About the photo... I hope it won't turn out too bad. I've always hated taking ID photos.

11.
Tell me about it! But no stress, we'll take a few, and you can pick the one you like best.
可不是嘛！不过别紧张，我们会多拍几张，你可以挑一张满意的。

12.
听你这么说，我就没那么紧张了。你们团队的氛围太温暖了，我都觉得我已经适应这里了。
Now that you say that, I feel less nervous. Your team has such a welcoming vibe. I already feel like I belong here!

13.
You will find your way before you know it! We hope you'll enjoy your time working here. Every day is different in our company.
你很快就能上手了！希望你喜欢在这儿工作。我们公司的每一天都不一样。

14.
太好了！这正是吸引我入职的原因。我知道在这工作不会无聊。我都等不及要开始啦。
Perfect! That's exactly why I joined. I know it won't be boring working here. I can't wait to start!

厉害！我们需要持续的配送。我很乐意多了解你的手做烘焙产品。

8.
我的香肠卷和馅饼，都是纯手工制作的，不是流水线生产，这样质量更好。
My sausage rolls and pies are all handcrafted, not mass-produced. That way, the quality is better.

9.
That's true. Not everyone has the capacity to do it these days. You must be doing well and have quite a following!
没错。现在并不是所有人都有能力做到这一点。你一定做得很好，很受顾客欢迎吧！

10.
确实，我的馅饼和香肠卷卖得很好，为了应付订单，我还多雇了五名员工，来满足更多顾客的需求。
That's true. My pies and sausage rolls have been selling really well. To keep up with my orders, I hired five extra staff to meet more customers' needs.

之前，在国内，我在服装店卖过衣服，也在餐馆做过服务员端盘子。
Back home, I worked in a clothing store selling clothes and I also waited tables as a waitress in a restaurant.

5.
That's really useful experience! Retail and hospitality are big employers here in Australia, with lots of openings. Would you like to stick with those industries?
这些经验很有用啊！零售和餐饮业在澳洲招人很多，机会很多的。您想继续在这两个行业里找工作吗？

6.
这两个领域，我都可以的。主要是，我的英语还不太溜，我怕我干活儿的时候，沟通费劲。
I'm fine with both of these fields. The main thing is, my English isn't very smooth yet, and I'm worried that communication will be tough when I'm working.

7.
No worries. Lots of employers in these areas hire new migrants and are patient with language barriers. They might start you with simpler tasks.
别担心。这些行业的许多雇主都招新移民，对语言障碍也很包容。通常他们会先给你安排些更简单的活儿。

8.
他们格局还挺大。我愿意先从简单点儿的活儿开始。你能给我推荐几份合适的工作吗？
They are very open-minded. I'm happy to start with simpler tasks. Could you recommend a few suitable jobs for me?

9.
Let me have a look through our job listings. Since you're into retail and hospitality, I'll look for entry-level roles in those fields.
我仔细查查我们的岗位库。既然您对零售和餐饮业感兴趣，我找找这些领域里入门的岗位。

10.
非常感谢你。我想能尽快上岗，挣些钱养活自己，至少，让自己能吃饱饭。
Thank you so much. I'd like to start working soon and earn some money to support myself. At least put food on the table.

11.
I get that! Starting with an entry-level job is smart. You'll build local work experience and sharpen your English. Any other questions or concerns?
我懂。从入门级岗位开始干很明智，这样您能积累本地工作经验，也能练习英语。还有其他问题或顾虑吗？

12.
暂时没有了！真是太谢谢你的帮助了！回头，要是遇到什么麻烦，我再来请教您。
Not at the moment, thank you so much for your help. If I run into any problems later, I'll come back for your advice.

After eating, I always feel bloated, and sometimes I also feel a bit nauseous.

5.
That must be quite unpleasant. Have you ever used anything for indigestion before, or is this the first time you've had these issues?
你肯定很难受吧！您以前用过什么药治疗消化不良吗，还是这是您第一次出现这样的情况？

6.
这还是头一次呢！我以前从来不胃胀的，所以我也不知道我该吃什么药。
This is the first time. My stomach has never been bloated before, so I'm not sure what medicine to take.

7.
No worries. We've got a few over-the-counter drugs for indigestion. I'd suggest trying one that lowers stomach acid.
别担心。我们有好几种非处方药可以缓解消化不良，我推荐您试试能抑制胃酸的那类药。

8.
谢谢你。这药我应该怎么吃呢？比如，是饭前吃，还是饭后吃？一天要吃几次呢？
Thank you. How should I take the medicine? For example, before or after meals, and how many times a day?

9.
For acid reducers, you can take them right after eating, or any time you start to feel discomfort.
对于抑酸药，您可以一吃完东西就服用，或者，一感觉不舒服就吃。

10.
好的，那这类药有没有什么常见的副作用呢？吃药的时候，我需要注意些什么吗？
Okay. Are there any common side effects for this type of medicine? Anything I should be aware of when I take them?

11.
Acid reducers are generally safe, though they may occasionally cause constipation or diarrhea. Most folks handle them just fine.
抑酸药通常很安全，但有时会导致便秘或腹泻。不过大多数人吃了都没事儿。

12.
了解，谢谢你的建议！我会挑一款，试用一下的。希望能快点缓解这些症状啊。
Got it, thanks for the advice. I'll pick one to try and hope it eases my symptoms soon.

13.
No problem. If you still feel off after a week, I'd recommend you see your GP to find out what's really going on.
没问题。如果一周后还不舒服，建议找全科医生看看到底怎么了。

14.
好的，我会记住的。非常感谢你的帮助！希望这药对我马上就能有效，不用再去看医生了！
Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks a lot for your help! Hopefully, this medicine works right away, and I won't need to see a doctor!

您好，快请进！我厨房橱柜的门，出了点问题。铰链有些松动了，所以，门关不上了。
Hello, come on in! There's something wrong with my kitchen cabinet door. The hinge is a bit loose, so the door won't close.

3.
Got it. Older cabinets often have this issue. Let me check those hinges properly. Oh! They're completely rusted.
明白了。老橱柜常有这毛病。我好好检查下铰链。哦！它们已经完全生锈了。

4.
对的，这套橱柜已经用了很多年了，材料可能开始老化了。
Right, this set of cabinets has been in use for years and the material probably starts to wear out.

5.
These hinges are worn, and the wood around them is chipped. I need to replace the hinges and patch up the wood.
这些铰链已经磨损了，周围的木头也掉渣了。得换铰链了，还得把木头补好。

6.
好的，我没问题。如果要换新的铰链，费用是多少？还有，大概需要多长时间？
Alright, I'm fine with that. If we're replacing the hinges, how much would it cost? Also, roughly how long does it take?

7.
Replacing the hinges and reinforcing the wood frame will run you about two hundred dollars, labour and materials included.
更换铰链，还有加固木头框架，大概需要200澳币，包括材料和人工费。

8.
明白了。那您估计需要多长时间修好呢？如果能尽快完成就太好了。我今天还要准备一顿大餐。
Got it. How long do you estimate the repair will take? It'd be great if it could be done quickly. I have a big meal to prepare today.

9.
It'll only take around two hours. If you're happy with the quote, I can get started immediately. Won't mess with your big dinner plans!
大概两小时就能完成。如果您对报价满意，我现在就可以开始。不会影响你的大餐计划的！

10.
那可以。我就怕厨房用不了，所以能尽快修好就最好了。柜子坏了很不方便。
That's okay. I'm just worried about not having a functional kitchen, so I'd appreciate a quick fix. Broken cabinets are such a hassle!

11.
No worries. You'll have your kitchen back by this afternoon. I'll just grab my tools from the van, you know, drill and stuff.
别担心，你的厨房今天下午就能恢复使用啦。我这就去面包车上拿一下工具，就那些，电钻什么的。

12.
谢谢您。您修理的时候，我需要清空柜子吗？我可以在厨房做点简单的事吗？
Thank you. While you're working, do I need to empty the cabinets? Can I still do some light stuff in the kitchen?

13.
It would be great if you could empty these cabinets, so I have room to work safely. Don't use the stove for safety, but feel free to use the sink.
最好把这些橱柜清空，这样我有空间安全工作。出于安全原因，请不要用炉灶，不过水槽随便用。

14.
谢谢您的提醒，我会把橱柜里的东西都挪到一边去的。非常感谢您的专业和效率！
Thanks for the heads-up! I'll move everything in the cabinets aside. I really appreciate how professional and efficient you are!

Hi there, I'm Robin. I just saw a moving van parked around here earlier, and I thought I'd come and say hi.
你好，我是罗宾。我刚看到这附近停着一辆搬家货车，就想过来打个招呼。

好呀！太棒了！对了，商业中心里头有邮局吗？要是有的话，对我来说就太方便啦。
Sure! That'd be great! By the way, is there a post office in the business center? If so, that'd be super handy for me.

7.
Yep! It's on the first floor, all the way in the back. The people working there are really helpful.
有的！就在一楼最里头。那儿的工作人员也非常热心。

8.
我前阵子在电视上还看到，商业中心的邮局还卖各种东西，甚至有文具。

That sounds perfect! Go have a look! They usually have super cute ones with cartoon prints.
听上去很棒！你去看看就知道啦。他们那儿经常有印着卡通图案的可爱毯子。

12.
那我可要经常去转转了，期待体验一下那里的服务和商品。
Then I should go check it out often. I'm looking forward to trying their services and seeing what they sell.

13.
Mornings tend to be less busy. The lines are shorter and it's less crowded before the lunch rush.
通常早上人比较少，排队短，中午饭点儿之前的那阵子，人会更少。

14.
这些信息太有帮助了。罗宾，认识你真好。我一安顿好，就请你去喝咖啡！
The information is so helpful. Robin, it's really nice meeting you. Coffee's on me once I'm all settled!

#70222. Bystander Assistance to Paramedic - Medical

1.
Hi there, I'm one of the paramedics. You said you made the call earlier. Can you walk me through what happened?
你好，我是其中一位急救人员。你说刚才是你打的电话。你能给我详细说说发生了什么吗？

2.
你好，这位男士刚才就在我面前突然倒下了，我看到他晕倒在地上了。
Hi. Just now, this man suddenly collapsed right in front of me. I saw him faint on the ground.

3.
Do you know how long he's been unconscious? Did you see any warning signs before he went down?
你知道他昏迷多久了吗？他倒下前，有没有表现出任何预兆？

4.
有两分钟左右了。倒下之前，他有点站不稳，脸色也很苍白。
About two minutes. Before he collapsed, he was a bit unsteady and looked very pale.

5.
Got it, thanks for the heads-up. I'm going to check his pulse and breathing right away.
明白，多谢告知。我现在马上检查他的脉搏和呼吸情况。

6.
这像是心脏病发作了？我还能帮上什么忙吗？比如找药什么的？
Is this a heart attack? What else can I do to help, like look for medication?

7.
I'm not certain yet. Please stay calm and move back a bit so I have room to work.
现在还不确定。请保持冷静，后退一点儿，好让我有空间操作。

8.
没问题。我往后退一点。我刚给打电话叫了救护车。救护车还有多久到？
No problem, I'll step back. I just called an ambulance. How long does it take for the ambulance to arrive?

9.
The ambulance is minutes away. Right now, I'm looking for any injuries from the fall, especially around his head and spine.
救护车几分钟就到。我现在在检查他的摔伤情况，特别是头部和脊椎附近。

10.
我刚才好像看到他头部撞到地了。需要在他脑袋下面，垫点软的东西吗？
I think I saw his head hit the ground just now. Should we put something soft under his head?

11.
It's better to leave him as he is for now, until we assess him properly. Moving him may cause further injury.
在我们好好检查他之前，最好先让他保持现状。动他可能会让他伤得更严重。

12.
明白，我不碰他。真希望他能快些恢复。大家也别慌啊！
Understood. I won't touch him. I really hope he recovers soon. Everyone stays calm!

13.
You did well by calling for help. The ambulance is almost here, and they will take over.
你打电话求助，做得很好。救护队快到了，他们会接手处理的。

#70221. Friendly Support for the New Town Doctor - Social

1.
Hello, nice to see you. I hope you're already settling in. It must be a big change for you to live in this small town. If you need anything, just let me know.
嗨，很高兴见到你。希望你已经安顿下来了。住在这么小的镇上，对你来说，肯定是个很大的改变。如果你需要什么，随时告诉我。

2.
是啊，我从来没在这么小的镇子上住过呢。而且，这里离市区也真的有点远。到最近的几个店，都要开车大概半小时。
Yeah, I've never lived in a town this small before. And it's really a bit far from the city. Driving to the nearest shops takes around 30 minutes.

3.
Yes, it takes a while for you to get used to it. I hope the sense of community can make it up. After all, everyone knows each other here.
是的，要适应得一段时间呢。我希望这里的社区氛围能弥补这点。毕竟，这里大家互相都认识。

4.
这个小镇上的人都很可爱。我适应得还不错。我的小诊所已经开了半年多，通过工作，我也认识了镇上大半的人。
The people in this small town are all really lovely. I'm adjusting well. My little clinic has been open for over six months, and through work I've met nearly half the town.

5.
I'm sure everyone is excited about the new doctor. The previous doctor moved back to the city. It took a while for the replacement doctor to arrive.
我肯定大家都对新医生感到很兴奋。之前的医生搬回城里了。过了好一阵子，才有替代的医生来。

6.
现在，我并不打算搬回去。但是，我确实很想念城市里的各种活动、很多东西，还有许多商店。
I don't plan to move back right now, but I do really miss all the events, things, and shops in the city.

7.
I understand. I can order goods for you, if it is something you use regularly, and my shop doesn't have it in stock.
我明白。如果有什么你经常用，我店里没货的东西，我可以帮你订。

8.
太好了，我们刚搬来时，买了几包咖啡豆。但是，快半年了，咖啡快喝完了。
Great, we bought a few bags of coffee beans when we just moved here, but after nearly half a year, we've almost run out of them.

9.
I heard from the receptionist that you have a really nice coffee machine at the doctor's clinic. You must be really missing your favourite brand.
我从前台那里听说，你在诊所里有台很棒的咖啡机。你肯定很想念你最喜欢的咖啡牌子吧。

10.
是的，一不喝咖啡，我一天的工作都没法干。我感觉我的每日咖啡摄入量已经超过健康标准了。
Yes. Without coffee, I can't get any work done all day. I feel my daily coffee intake has already gone beyond the healthy limits.

11.
You are not the only one. I will see if I can get your roast coffee delivered from my shop. If it arrives in good time, I'll let you know right away.
你不是唯一这样想的。我看看能不能从我店里给你订那款烘焙咖啡。要是能及时到，我立刻告诉你。

12.
非常感谢你。说不定你订了这些货之后，小镇上的其他居民也会很喜欢购买的。
Thank you so much. Maybe after you order these goods, the other residents in town will like buying them too.

13.
You never know. I'm glad I can help you. If you order by yourself, the delivery fee would be very high. I can get it much cheaper for you.
说不定呢。我很高兴能帮你。如果你自己订，运费会很贵。我帮你订，价格便宜得多。

14.
我觉得，这里的人一直都非常齐心协力，这也是住在小镇上最美好的事情之一。
I feel like people here always work together, and that's one of the best things about living in a small town.

#70220. Tenant Requests Pest Control - Business

1.
Hi, this is Tracy, your property manager. I got your voicemail and I'm just calling you back. Is everything okay?
你好，我是你的物业经理崔西。我收到你的语音留言，给你回电。请问一切都还好吗？

2.
你好。谢谢你这么快就给我回电话。我是新租客。我住的地方有些问题。
Hello. Thanks for calling back so quickly. I'm a new tenant. I'm having some issues at my place.

3.
I know you are a new tenant with our company, but it is best to notify us of any issues online, so we can have a written record.
我知道您是新租客，但您有任何问题，最好在网上告知我们，这样我们能有书面记录。

4.
哦，好的。我之前不知道，不过，您说的有道理。因为情况很紧急，我不确定该怎么办。
Oh okay. I didn't know that before, but what you said makes sense. Because this is urgent and I wasn't sure what to do.

5.
All notifications come to me straight away, so you can use our online system, even if the matter is urgent. So, tell me what's happening?
我立刻就能收到所有通知，所以就算紧急情况，您也可以使用我们的线上系统。那么，跟我说说您遇到什么问题了？

6.
今天早上，我有个工作会议。我去厨房准备早餐的时候，天还没亮呢。结果，我看到了一只老鼠！
This morning, I had a work meeting. When I went to the kitchen to make breakfast before sunrise, it was still dark outside. And then, I saw a mouse.

7.
Oh dear, that must have been disturbing to you. You haven't been leaving uncovered food scraps in the kitchen, have you?
天啊，这肯定吓到您了。您没有在厨房留下没盖好的食物残渣吧？

8.
当然没有啊。你知道的，我上周才搬进来。老鼠肯定早就在那儿了。老鼠这种动物太可怕了！
Of course not! As you know, I just moved in last week. The mouse must have been there already. Mice are such horrible creatures!

9.
Yes, you're right. They are not healthy, and they can also damage our homes. I will call the pest control company to help.
是的，您说得对。老鼠不卫生，还会破坏我们的房子。我会打电话给害虫防治公司来处理。

10.
谢谢，那太好了。我可不喜欢和那种有害的动物住在一起。它们可能传播病菌。
Thank you, that's great. I really don't want to live with those kinds of pests. They can spread germs.

11.
I understand. I'm sorry that no one noticed this problem before you moved in. But we will fix it quickly. I'll keep you updated.
我理解。很抱歉您搬进来前没人发现这个问题。但我们会尽快解决。我会随时让您知道进展的。

12.
感谢你。我不清楚害虫控制公司会怎么处理，希望我不需要搬出去。我才刚安顿下来。
Thanks. I'm not sure what the pest control will do exactly - I hope I won't have to move out. I've just settled in.

13.
No, I don't think so. For this type of pest, it's just a matter of removal. Hopefully, it won't take too long.
我觉得你不用搬的。这种害虫只需清除就行，希望不会花太长时间。

14.
好的，那我等你通知了。期待你早点告诉我害虫控制公司什么时候来。这样我可以安排时间。
Alright, I'll wait for your update. I'm hoping you can let me know soon when the pest control company will come, so I can plan my time.

#70219. Understanding Bill Payment Delays - Business

1.
Good morning. Thanks for reaching our bank. This is Ryan from the Customer Service Team. What brings your call today?
早上好，感谢致电我们银行。我是客服部的瑞安。您今天打电话过来是想咨询什么呢？

2.
早上好。我刚搬到澳大利亚，在你们银行开了个户。但是，这里的好多事情都让我摸不着头脑。
Good morning! I've just moved to Australia and opened an account with your bank, but I'm feeling a bit lost with how things work here.

3.
Don't worry. I'd be glad to answer any questions about your account. Loads of things here are probably different from your home country.
别担心。我很乐意回答您关于账户的任何问题。这里的很多事可能都和您原来的国家不一样。

4.
好多事情都跟之前不一样了。我正在逐渐适应呢。有时候我感觉自己的问题很傻，所以都不敢问。
Many things are different from before. I'm gradually getting used to it. Sometimes I feel my questions are very silly, so I don't dare ask.

5.
Don't worry. For many questions, our website has quick answers. But you can ask us directly if you still can't find what you need.
别担心。好多问题，我们网站上都能快速找到答案。不过您要是还找不到您要的，直接问我们。

6.
我支付每个月的账单都比较晚。我付了钱以后，还是会收到账单方的催款短信。
I always pay my monthly bills quite late. After I've paid the money, I still receive payment reminder messages from the billing company.

7.
It probably happens because you're paying on the due date. Some payments are still pending. Payments can take up to 2 days to go through.
估计是因为您踩着截止日付款。部分交易还在处理，到账最多需要2个工作日。

8.
我懂了。意思就是，钱确实从我的账户里划走了，但收款人不能马上能收到钱。
I see. So the money is definitely deducted from my account, but the recipient won't receive it immediately.

9.
Exactly. Also, it's good to note that payments made on weekends or public holidays might get delayed a bit more.
没错。另外，您需要注意的是，周末或公共假期的支付可能会多耽搁些时间。

10.
知道这些窍门后，办银行业务就能顺手多了。我现在开始习惯网上付款啦。
Now that I know these tips, handling banking tasks could be much easier. I'm getting used to online payments.

11.
Our bank's app has multiple ways to pay. You can handle the payments yourself easily, which should be very handy for you.
我们银行的应用有多种付款方式。您自己就可以轻松管理支付，这应该对您来说非常方便。

12.
有时我还是很怀念可以去分行，跟柜员当面聊一聊，尤其是碰上搞不明白的事儿的时候。
Sometimes I do miss going to a branch to talk with a bank clerk in person, especially when I'm confused about something.

13.
I get that. Just remember, our hotline is always here if you need help or have any questions.
理解。您只需要记着：您需要帮助或有问题时，我们的热线随时为您服务。

14.
非常感谢您的帮助。我现在不那么垂头丧气了。如果我还有需要帮忙的地方，我一定会再打电话给您。
Thank you so much for your help. I'm less frustrated now. If I need further assistance, I'll definitely call you again.

#70218. Van Theft Report and Insurance Steps - Legal

1.
Hi there, you've reached the non-urgent police assistance line. Constable Brown speaking. How can I help you today?
你好，这里是非紧急警务服务热线。我是布朗警员。今天我有什么能帮忙的吗？

2.
布朗警官，你好。我想报告一个情况，不确定算不算案件。但是我非常着急。
Hello Officer Brown, I want to report something. I'm not sure if it counts as a case. But I'm really worried about it.

3.
You've got the right line for non-emergency reports. If it's urgent, you'll need to hang up and dial 000.
您拨打的是非紧急报案电话。如果是紧急情况，你需要挂掉电话，然后拨打000。

4.
不是紧急的，就是我的面包车被偷了。是在我昨天工作的地方被偷的。不过我人没事。
It's not an emergency, it's just that my van was stolen. It was stolen from where I was working yesterday. But I'm physically fine.

5.
Discovering something stolen is always upsetting. Even non-urgent matters can be serious. Let's go over what happened so I can assist you.
发现东西被偷总是让人心烦。就算不算紧急，也可以是很严重的。我们过一下事情经过吧，我好帮你处理。

6.
主要是，这车是我干活用的，丢了很麻烦。保险公司让我先搞个报案单，然后才能申请赔付。
The main thing is that it's my work vehicle, losing it is a real headache. The insurance company wants me to get a police report first, then I can file a claim.

7.
Understood, work vehicles are crucial. So, a van was taken? Sounds like you need a theft report for the insurer. Tell me where and when you last saw it.
明白了，工作车辆很重要。那么，被偷的是一辆面包车？听起来你需要给保险公司提供一份盗窃报案单。告诉我你最后见到它的地点和时间。

8.
昨天上午，我在建筑工地干活。大概中午那会儿，发现我的面包车给人偷了。
Yesterday morning, while I was working at the construction site, around noon, I realized my van was stolen.

9.
Oh no, that's terrible! Vans are common targets for thieves. Whether the vehicle is locked or not, they know how to break in quickly.
哎呀，这太糟了！面包车是小偷的常见目标。不管车子有没有锁，他们都知道怎么快速弄开。

10.
车我锁好了，但没安防盗报警。要是有报警器，可能就把贼吓跑了。
I locked it up, but there was no anti-theft alarm. If there had been an alarm, it might have scared the thief off.

11.
Getting an alarm is definitely smart. But those pros can work so fast that sometimes an alarm doesn't even slow them down.
装报警器当然很明智。但那些专业小偷的动作太快，以至于有时候报警器甚至都拦不住他们。

12.
这件事就能显出保险的价值了。就算我的面包车最终找不回来，至少我还能拿到赔偿金。
This shows the value of insurance. Even if my van can't be recovered in the end, I can at least get the payout.

13.
Please tell me a few more details, like the location, time, any witnesses, and I'll give you a report reference number for your insurer.
请多告诉我几个细节，比如地点、时间、有无目击者，然后我会给您一个报案编号，您可以提供给保险公司。

14.
感谢你。一拿到报案号，我就马上联系保险公司。这个面包车可是我的血汗钱买的啊！
Thank you. As soon as I get the case number, I'll contact the insurance company right away. That van was bought with my hard-earned money!

#70217. Clarifying Local Dog Leash Rules - Legal

1.
Good afternoon, you have reached the City Council. How may I help you today?
下午好，这里是市政厅。今天有什么可以帮您的？

2.
你好，我想咨询一下这里遛狗的法律法规。听说有些邻居看到狗就吓一跳，所以我想先搞清楚规矩。
Hello, I want to ask about the dog-walking regulations here. I heard some neighbours get startled when they see dogs, so I'd like to know the rules first.

3.
Absolutely! Having a dog means following rules. We've got straightforward regulations to keep everyone safe. Have you had a chance to check any local regulations?
当然可以！养狗意味着要守规矩。我们有明文规定来保障每个人的安全。您有看过本地的相关法规吗？

4.
具体还真的不太清楚。我就知道得给狗拴上牵绳，但是，像狗狗能不能去海滩这些细节，我就懵了。
I'm not really sure about the details. I just know I have to leash my dog, but when it comes to details like whether dogs are allowed on the beach, I'm completely lost.

5.
Your dog needs to be leashed in public spaces. However, we have two designated off-leash parks where they can roam. Also, the southern section of the beach is also leash-free!
在公共区域必须给狗拴牵绳。不过，我们有两个专门的无牵绳公园，可以让狗狗自由奔跑。海滩的南段也允许放开牵绳。

6.
太棒了。我的狗特别喜欢在水里踩来踩去，在沙子里打滚，还会追那些海鸥。请问有哪些地方是不允许狗狗去的吗？
That's great. My dog loves splashing around in the water, rolling in the sand, and chasing seagulls. Are there any spots where dogs aren't allowed?

7.
Indeed, dogs aren't allowed in certain spots like kids' playgrounds, sports ovals, and some beaches. Just look out for the signs before you go in.
确实，有些地方不允许带狗，比如儿童游乐场、运动场以及部分沙滩。进去前留意公告牌就行。

8.
了解了。如果我一不留神，没有遵守规定，会有什么处罚吗？最惨会怎么样呀？
Understood. If I accidentally don't follow the rules, what penalties might I face? What's the worst that could happen?

9.
If you break the rules, like letting your dog off-leash where it's banned, you might get fined. Fines vary based on how serious the breach is.
如果违反规定，比如在禁止区域不牵绳，就可能被罚款。罚金数额取决于违规的严重程度。

10.
我的狗狗很热情，见人就扑，我还真的要多留意。还有什么其他遛狗时要注意的吗？
My dog's so friendly—always jumps on everyone it meets. I really need to pay extra attention. Any other dog-walking dos and don'ts I need to look out for?

11.
Absolutely, remember to pick up after your dog. Leaving dog waste means a fine as well. We've placed bins in most parks.
没错，记得清理狗狗的排泄物。没有清理也意味着被罚款。我们在大多数公园里都设有垃圾箱。

12.
我一定会清理狗狗的粪便的。谢谢你的解答！要不是你提醒，我还真没注意这些细节呢。
I'll definitely clean up after my dog. Thanks for your explanation! If you hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have noticed those details.

13.
Anytime! You can also check the council's website for off-leash maps. If anything else comes up, swing by our office or give us a ring.
随时乐意效劳。您还可以在市政厅网站上查看不用牵绳区域的地图。如果还有其他问题，可以来我们办公室或打电话咨询。

14.
太好了，我这就去看一下网站上的地图。这周末我就带它去那个海滩的南边。再次感谢你的帮助！
Great, I'll check the map on the website right away. I'll take my dog down to the south end of the beach this weekend. Thanks again for your help!

1.
Hi. You've reached the police station. Constable Smith speaking. How may I assist you today?
你好！这里是警察局，我是史密斯警员。今天有什么能帮你的吗？

2.
您好，我要投诉我们公寓小区里有位司机开车一直超速。我们都觉得很危险。而且感觉车子发动机很强，非常吵。
Hi there, I'd like to report a driver in our apartment complex who keeps speeding. We all think it's really dangerous. Also, the car's engine seems really powerful and super loud.

3.
I hear you. People should drive slowly in an apartment complex, especially near kids' play areas or sidewalks. Where and when did the speeding happen?
我理解。大家在公寓小区里开车一定要慢点，尤其是在孩子玩的地方或人行道附近。超速是在什么地方、什么时候发生的？

4.
其实，我每天送孩子去学校的时候，都看到他车子飞速开过去。最近的一次发生在今天早上七点半左右，就在我们公寓小区门口。
Actually, every day when I take my kid to school, I see him speeding past in his car. The most recent time was around 7:30 this morning, right at the entrance of our apartment complex.

5.
That does sound risky. Do you happen to know the car's make and model, or any other identifying info?
听起来很危险。您知道那车是什么牌子、什么型号，或者还有其他辨识特征吗？

6.
是辆银色的车。车牌号我没看清，是我们小区一位年轻人开的。表情还非常嚣张呢。
It's a silver car. I didn't catch the license plate number, but it's driven by a young person who lives in our complex. And he always has this cocky look on his face.

7.
Thanks for that. Have you heard if anyone else has noticed this, or if this driver has been involved in any other incidents?
感谢您的信息。您知道有没有其他人也注意到这事，或者这个司机还有没有发生过别的事故？

8.
好多邻居都看到过呢，对他都快闻风丧胆了。他开车像疯了一样快，我们都很担心孩子们的安全。
Plenty of our neighbours have seen him too and are almost scared stiff of him. He drives insanely fast, and we're all really worried about the kids' safety.

9.
I understand. I'll dispatch a patrol car to monitor the area at those times, and if we can pinpoint the driver, we'll have a word with him.
我明白。我会在那个时段派巡逻警车去监控那个区域，如果我们能确认司机身份，我们会跟他谈谈的。

10.
谢谢警察同志。我们都希望他能明白这样做的后果，不要再超速了。我们想看到明显的改善。
Thank you, officer. We all hope he can understand the consequences of what he has done and can stop speeding. We really want to see some real improvement.

11.
We'll do everything we can to address this. If you spot anything like this again, please let us know immediately.
我们会尽全力处理。如果您再发现类似情况，请马上向我们报告。

12.
我会盯着他的。非常感谢你们的协助。我们真不希望每天送孩子的时候都捏一把汗啊！
I'll keep an eye on him. Thanks so much for your help. We really don't want to feel on edge every single morning when we're taking our kids to school.

13.
No worries. Our top priority is everyone's safety. Have a great day, and stay safe out there.
不客气。安全是我们的首要任务。祝您愉快，注意安全。

14.
谢谢。希望早点抓到那个坏蛋，给他点教训。如果还有任何情况，我会第一时间联系警局。
Thank you. I hope you can catch that troublemaker soon and teach him a lesson. If anything else comes up, I will contact the police immediately.

#70215. Inspecting An Off-Market Property - Business

1.
Hi there! Long time no see! I had no clue you are house hunting!
嘿！好久不见！我不知道你在看房呢。

2.
是呀。我们租房子住好多年了，我觉得，是时候买下一套属于自己的房子啦。
Exactly, we've been renting for years and I feel it's time to have a place of my own.

3.
I totally get it. This area's super convenient, with the mall and the park nearby. If you moved elsewhere, you'd have to re-learn everything all over again.
我完全明白。这地段多方便啊，商场公园都在旁边。要是搬到别的地方，你就得重新熟悉一遍周边环境。

4.
可不是嘛，能不动地方最好了。我们不想让孩子们又要换学校，又要重新适应一遍周围的一切。
Absolutely, staying put would be ideal. We don't want the kids to have to switch schools and adjust to everything all over again.

5.
Exactly. The market is flooded with listings now, but it might take a bit to find the right one. Any luck so far?
确实，市面上现在房源很多，但找到合适的可能需要点时间。目前你有看中的吗？

6.
我们看了不少房子了，有一套房子我们特别中意，但是，价格超标了。我们不想让手头太紧。
We've seen quite a few properties. There's one we really like, but it's over our budget. We don't want to stretch our finances.

7.
That's a shame. But it's smart to stick to your budget. Don't worry, it doesn't mean you won't find something you love. There's plenty of fish in the sea.
真可惜，不过，量入为出是对的。别急，这不代表你们找不到喜欢的房子。好房子多的是。

8.
我们希望能买一套空房子，这样一切都简单。我不喜欢到处堆满家具和杂物的房子。我觉得我们没办法搬进那样的房子。
We'd like an empty property — that keeps things simple. I don't like houses cluttered with furniture and stuff; I don't think we could move into one like that.

9.
You may want to focus on the floor plan, rather than getting distracted by the furnishings. Decorations can always be changed later.
或许，你们可以关注房子的户型图，而不是被家具干扰。房子的装饰到后面都能改的。

10.
有些户型我们就是接受不了。我们不想要复式，只想要平层。
Some layouts just won't work for us; we don't want a two-story home—we prefer a single-level place.

11.
It might be worth checking out some of the older homes in the area. They often match what you're looking for. I can help you find them.
或许可以看看这个区一些年代久一些的房子——它们往往更符合你们的需求。我可以帮你找找。

12.
谢谢你。我们不想大改结构。最多，微调一两个房间的布局，就可以啦。
Thank you. We don't want major renovations. At most, we'd just tweak the layout of one or two rooms.

13.
Actually, there's one property that could be perfect, but it's not officially listed. I know the owner personally, and can set up an inspection.
其实，有一处房产可能很合适，但房子还没挂牌呢。我认识屋主，可以帮你们安排看房。

14.
太好了。帮我们安排一下吧。希望这次能成。真希望这套房子能满足我们全家的需求啊。
Fantastic! Please help arrange it for us. Fingers crossed this works out! I really hope this house will meet our family's needs.

#70214. Customer Calls About Faulty Washer - Business

1.
Hi there, this is the appliance shop speaking. My name is Adrian. How can I assist you today?
你好，这里是电器商店。我是艾德利安。今天我能为您做点什么？

2.
你好！我前段时间在你们这里买了一台洗衣机，但最近坏掉了，总是发出尖锐的噪音，吓得我已经一周没用它了。
Hey there! I bought a washing machine from you guys a while back, but it's been faulty lately. It always makes a piercing noise, and I've been too scared to use it for a week.

3.
Oh no, sorry to hear that. Do you remember exactly when you bought it? If it's still under warranty, we might be able to fix it at no cost.
哎呀，听到这些我很抱歉。你还记得具体什么时候买吗？如果还在保修期内，我们可能可以免费维修。

4.
我是五个月前买的，之前一直运转得挺不错的，我原本还挺满意的。结果现在噪音又刺耳，又漏水。
I bought it five months ago, and it was working great. I was actually pretty happy with it. But now it's getting so noisy and it's even leaking water.

5.
That should still be covered. Would you prefer getting it repaired, or would you rather we replace it for you?
这应该还在保修范围内。你希望我们修理它，还是换一台新的给你？

6.
是说我不用出钱修吗？我有点搞不清保修是什么意思。维修费用是不是都很高啊？
Does that mean I don't have to pay? I'm not too sure what warranty really means. Is repair usually expensive?

7.
Exactly. Warranty means we'll cover the repair or even replace it for free, as long as the issue wasn't caused by misuse.
没错。保修就是在一定时间内，只要不是人为损坏，维修或更换都是免费的。

8.
太好了。我之前还担心得自己掏钱修。那我就放心了。我还是想把原机修好。
Great. I was worried I'd have to pay out of pocket. Then I'm relieved. I'd prefer to get the original machine fixed.

9.
Got it. I'll make sure a technician gets out to you soon. Can you tell me when someone can come by?
明白了。我会安排技术员尽快过去。您什么时候方便让人上门看看？

10.
这个嘛，我做零售促销兼职，周一和周五不上班，这两天安排都可以。
Sure, I work part-time in retail promotions, and I'm off on Mondays and Fridays. Either of those days works for me.

11.
That works. One of our technicians will reach out to set up an appointment. The technician may need to run a diagnostic cycle to identify the fault.
好的。我们的技师会联系你预约具体时间。技师可能需要运行诊断程序来找出故障。

12.
这一套操作下来大概要多久？希望能快点修好。我在家等着的时候，要准备些什么吗？比如螺丝刀？
How long does the whole process usually take? I really hope the washer gets fixed soon. When I'm waiting at home, should I have anything ready—like a screwdriver?

13.
The basic check usually takes about half an hour, and if we need to open it up for a motor inspection, it will be around sixty minutes. You don't have to get any tools ready.
整套流程大概半小时，如果需要拆机检查电机，会大概60分钟。你不需要准备任何工具。

14.
好。那我在家等他们过来检查吧，希望不要是电机的问题。谢谢你的耐心服务。
Alright, I'll wait at home for them to come check it. Hopefully, it's not a problem with the motor. Thanks for your patience.

#70213. Strategies for School Band Fundraising - Business

1.
Hey, come on in and grab a chair! My bad for being swamped yesterday! Now I've got all the time to chat about this.
嗨，快进来坐吧。昨天我太忙了实在不好意思，现在我时间很充裕，咱们慢慢聊。

2.
我之前是想跟你讨论，怎么给我们的学校乐队筹集资金，让孩子们有更多资金参加音乐巡演。你有什么想法吗？
I wanted to talk with you about how to raise some money for our school band, so the kids can have more funds to go on music tours. Do you have any ideas?

3.
Well, I feel like we could totally put together a fundraiser. We just need to pick the right kind of event, like the kind of event people would jump at attending.
嗯，我感觉咱们完全可以搞个筹款活动。我们只需要选对活动类型，需要大家迫不及待抢着来参加的那种活动。

4.
要不，我们弄一本附近商家的优惠券手册，卖给家长和社区居民？或者搞些附近商家的东西卖钱，怎么样？
How about this: we put together a coupon book with deals from the local businesses, and sell it to parents and people in the community? Or maybe we could sell some products from the local shops to raise money?

5.
These are all great ideas. But hey, how about putting on a concert for the school band? We could use the school's venue and equipment, which would help keep the costs down.
这些都很棒。不过哎，你觉得给学校乐队办场音乐会怎么样？我们可以用学校的场地和设施，这样可以节约开支。

6.
这主意靠谱！可以展现孩子们的才艺！家长们肯定乐意出钱支持的。我们多宣传，绝对人气爆棚！
That's a solid idea! It'd be a great way to show off the kids' talents. I'm sure the parents would be more than happy to chip in and support. If we really get the word out, people will definitely come!

7.
I think it's a solid idea too! Hosting the event at school would save us a lot on venue costs. We could also invite a few local bands to come and perform.
我也觉得很好！在学校办活动，能省下大笔的场地费。我们还可以再请些本地乐队来表演助阵。

8.
我喜欢这个点子！还能让音乐会更专业，更热闹！乐队成员的亲友团绝对会来撑场子的！
I love that idea! It would make the concert more professional and way more exciting. The band members' friends and families are definitely gonna show up to support!

9.
Yeah, seeing these local bands could really motivate the kids to rehearse harder. Plus, the local bands might promote the concert on their social media too!
是的，孩子们看到这些本地乐队，会更有动力排练。本地乐队也可能会在社交媒体宣传这次音乐会！

10.
太棒了，那就等于免费宣传了！我们可以再发动家长们制作蛋糕，甜点和饮料来义卖。
Awesome, that basically means free promotion! We could also get the parents to make some cakes, desserts, and drinks to sell for fundraising.

11.
Genius! That way, the vibe will be way more enjoyable! It would make the whole thing more fun for everyone!
妙啊！这样现场气氛更愉快，每个人都能待得更开心！

12.
可以！细节方面，咱们得再敲定一下，还要联系附近商家，拉拉赞助。
Sounds good! We'll just need to finalize the details and reach out to some local businesses for sponsorship.

13.
Absolutely! Shall we chat again the day after tomorrow? We'll also need to apply early for permission to use the school venue.
必须的！后天我们再碰一次怎么样？我们也需要早点跟学校申请场地使用的许可。

14.
好的，咱们到时候可以谈谈怎么分头联系家长和商家。我这几天先列个待办清单。
Alright. We can then figure out how to divide things up—like who'll talk to the parents and who'll reach out to the local businesses. I'll put together a to-do list over the next few days.

#70212. Newcomer Navigates Waste Sorting and Gardening - Business

1.
Hi! We haven't had a proper chat since you moved here! Found any good spots around here?
你好呀！自从你搬来，我们还没怎么好好聊过呢！发现附近有什么好地方了吗？

2.
你好。我暂时只摸清了超市和学校。不过，昨天我发现，这里的垃圾分类很不同。我正想找人问问呢。
Hi! So far, I've just figured out the supermarket and the school. But yesterday I noticed the waste sorting system here is quite different. I was just wanting to ask someone about it.

3.
Ah! The Aussie bin system! That confuses everyone at first. Tell me what's puzzling you?
啊！澳洲的垃圾桶系统啊！刚开始确实让人糊涂。跟我说说你哪里不明白呀？

4.
比如，为什么有三个不同颜色的垃圾桶？还有哪些垃圾要单独处理吗？
Like, why are there three different colored bins? And what waste needs separate handling?

5.
Well, the red lid is for general waste, the yellow one is for recycling, and the green one is for organics. Some items, like batteries, need special drop-off. Most supermarkets take them.
嗯，红色盖子装普通垃圾，黄色回收，绿色有机垃圾。像电池这种特殊物品要单独处理。多数超市都有回收点。

6.
哦，所以，电池要单独处理呀。那么，旧的电子设备，我该扔到哪里呀？
Oh, so batteries need separate handling. Where should I dispose of old electronic devices then?

7.
The City Council holds an e-waste collection day quarterly. The next one will be in October, at the community centre.
市政厅会每个季度办电子垃圾回收日，下次在十月，地点在社区中心。

8.
了解了。我还想种菜，我需要买几个高架菜床、一根浇水软管，还有其他园艺工具。你知道在哪里买吗？
Got it. I also want to grow some vegetables. I need to get a few raised garden beds, a watering hose, and some other gardening tools. Do you know where to buy them?

9.
I'd say, the gardening centre along the highway is your best bet. It's quite big, and usually has a wider range of stuff.
我觉得公路那边的园艺中心是你最好的选择。那地方挺大的，通常种类也更多。

10.
太好了。我搬家的时候啥园艺工具都没带过来。运费实在太贵了。所以现在我得重新添置一批。
Great. I didn't bring any gardening tools with me when I moved here. The shipping costs are too high. So now I've got to buy everything again.

11.
I see. Picking out new tools can actually be pretty fun. Plus, that place isn't too pricey, which is a bonus.
我明白。其实挑新的工具也挺有意思的。而且那家店的价格不太贵，这算是个额外的好处。

12.
太好了。我已经迫不及待想种点东西了，就是这边的环境跟我的祖国那边差很多。
Great. I really can't wait to plant something, it's just that the environment here is so different from back home.

13.
How about I come with you to the gardening centre now? We can pick plants that grow well in our soil.
要不我现在陪你去园艺中心？我们可以选些适合本地土壤的植物。

14.
那太好了！我正担心选错植物呢。我们走吧，我开车，你可以坐副驾，给我指指路呀！
That'd be wonderful! I was just worried about choosing the wrong plants. Let's go. I'll drive, and you can sit up front and guide me.

#70211. Puppy Course: Commands & Grooming - Business

1.
Hey! I'm the lead trainer at the Dog Training Center. My coworker mentioned you just adopted an adorable male puppy. What can I help you with?
你好！我是狗狗训练中心的首席训犬师。我同事说你刚领养了一只可爱的小公狗。我能帮你些什么？

2.
你好。是的，我刚领养了一只小狗。听说你们的小狗训练课程口碑很好，我想多了解一下。
Hi! Yeah, I just adopted a puppy. I heard your puppy training course has a great reputation. I'd love to learn more.

3.
Absolutely! We offer a six-week course here that covers basic commands and hands-on handling techniques.
当然。我们这儿有个为期六周的课程，包括基本指令和实操训狗技巧。

4.
听起来很棒呀！我们家领养的小狗特别可爱的，很通人性，但也挺淘气。我想尽快让它开始上课。
That sounds great! The puppy we adopted is super cute. He is intuitive, but he is also quite naughty. I'd love to get him started with the course as soon as possible.

5.
That's a smart move! Puppies are adorable, and it's simpler to nip unwanted habits in the bud. Our next session starts in just a few days.
这个想法非常明智！小狗都很可爱，早点纠正坏习惯也会更容易。我们下期课几天后就开始了。

6.
那时间正好合适。我的孩子们经常跟小狗一起玩，所以我还想让孩子们一起参加，让他们也学学。
That's perfect timing! My kids play with the puppy all the time, so I'd love for them to join too—that way they can learn together.

7.
Absolutely! The class will teach your kids how to handle the puppy, especially how to keep him under control during walks.
当然可以。课程会教你的孩子们控犬技巧，特别是遛狗时怎么控制小狗。

8.
太好啦！我的孩子们一个十岁，一个八岁，希望他们可以学习怎么照顾小狗，比如，怎么遛狗，怎么给小狗护理毛发，怎么科学喂养。
That's amazing! My kids are ten and eight, and I hope they could learn how to take care of the puppy, you know, stuff like walking him, grooming him, and feeding him properly.

9.
Well, our course is a perfect fit then! The course also includes socialization training. We'll teach your pup how to interact with people and other animals.
嗯，那我们的课程就正合适啦。我们的课程还包社交训练，会教你家小狗怎么跟人和其他动物相处。

10.
太好啦。课程的价格是多少？课程会包含小狗笼养训练和上厕所训练吗？
That's great! How much does the course cost? And does it include crate training and potty training for the puppy?

11.
Rest assured, the course covers everything! You're in good hands! It's 200 dollars for six weeks. By the way, is your pup up to date on all his shots?
放心吧，课程内容全包的。交给我们绝对靠谱的。课程价格是六周200澳币。对了，你的小狗疫苗打全了吗？

12.
课程价格挺合理的。下一期课我们能参加吗？小狗的疫苗都打过了。兽医给我疫苗证明了。
The price sounds very reasonable. Can we join the next session? The puppy's got all his shots. The vet gave me his vaccination certificate.

13.
Perfect! Let's get the little guy signed up now. Don't forget his shot records when you attend the first lesson!
太棒啦！咱们现在就给小家伙报名吧。第一堂课别忘了带好所有疫苗证明哟！

14.
太好啦。放心，我会带着的。希望能培养出一只听话不捣蛋的小狗！
Perfect! No worries, I'll bring them. Hope we can raise a well-behaved, non-mischievous puppy!

#70210. Making Use of a Spare Skip Bin - Business

1.
Hey, long time no see! How are things shaping up with your new business?
嘿，好久不见！你的新生意做得怎么样？

2.
你好呀！刚开始的几个月，真的挺辛苦的，不过，好在生意现在开始红火了，跟之前比，现在我忙多了。
Hey! The first few months were really tough, but gladly business is getting busy now. Compared to before, I'm way busier these days!

3.
That's great news. I've been told the previous owner of this building left a ton of junk here when they left.
太好了。我听说这栋楼上一个房主搬走时，在这留下了一堆垃圾。

4.
确实，真让人头疼啊。我这阵子全心投入到生意里了，都没来得及顾这事呢。
Yeah, it's such a headache. I've been so wrapped up in the business that I haven't had a chance to deal with it.

5.
Actually, I could lend a hand. You probably saw that I got a skip bin delivered here last month.
实际上，我可以帮你一把。你可能看到了上个月我这送来一个大型垃圾箱。

6.
那么大的垃圾箱，我当然看到啦！你是打算用它清理仓库垃圾吗？你的垃圾肯定不少啊！
Of course I saw that huge skip bin! You're using it to clean out the warehouse, right? You must have a ton of junk!

7.
Funny enough, I don't. It turned out much bigger than I thought. It's only half full at the moment. Do you need to use it for your trash?
搞笑的是，我其实没多少垃圾。这箱子比我想象的大多了，现在才装了半箱。你要用这箱子扔你的垃圾吗？

8.
求之不得！谢谢你！我怀疑前一个业主压根没处理过垃圾，我能轻松就能把垃圾箱装满。
Perfect! Thank you! I doubt the previous owner never cleared the junk. I could easily fill this skip bin!

9.
Perfect! Make use of it! It'd be a shame to let it sit empty. Hiring it costs a lot!
太好了！赶紧用起来！空着不用太浪费了。租这东西可不便宜啊！

10.
我知道租大垃圾箱有多贵，特别是租一周的话。你要我帮你分担一下费用吗？或者我可以给你的车提供一次保养，来感谢你给我用垃圾箱，这帮我省掉了大麻烦。
I know how expensive it is to hire a skip bin, especially for a whole week. Want me to chip in? Or I could give your car a service as a thank you! — you just saved me a ton of hassle!

11.
I'd really appreciate your generous offer! Fantastic! My car's due for a service anyway, so that's perfect.
感谢你这么大方！太好了！我车本来也该保养了，这下正好。

12.
非常乐意效劳！哪天你方便了，把钥匙给我就行。不会花太久时间的。
Happy to help! Whenever it's convenient for you, just give me the car key. It won't take long.

13.
Thanks. Just say the word if you need a hand hauling the junk. I'll leave the skip bin here till the weekend.
谢谢。如果需要帮忙搬垃圾，跟我说一声。我会把垃圾箱留到周末。

14.
真是太感谢你能帮忙了。如果你方便的话，我现在就可以开始清理。
I really appreciate your help. If you've got time now, I can start clearing out right away.

#70209. Birthday Book Dilemma - Business

1.
Hi there! I recall seeing you a few days back when you picked up that actor's biography.
嗨！我记得几天前见过你，那时候你买了那位演员的传记。

2.
你好！我本来想把这本书当作朋友的生日礼物，可她已经买过同一本了，因为她是那位演员的头号粉丝。
Hi! I was going to give this book as a birthday gift to my friend, but she already has bought one herself because she's a huge fan of that actor.

3.
Oh dear, that's unfortunate. Since she's such a fan, it really would have made an ideal present.
天哪，那太不巧了。既然她是粉丝，这本书本来可以是件完美的礼物啊。

4.
没错，这主意原本很棒的。当时，这本书很快就脱销了，但我还是设法买到了一本。
Yes, it was a great idea. At that time, the book sold out fast, but I managed to get a copy.

5.
I'm certain your friend will appreciate the effort and thought you made picking out a gift for her, despite how things turned out.
我相信你朋友肯定能感受到你给她挑礼物时花的心思和努力啦，不管结果如何。

6.
是啊，她还是收到了一些不错的礼物的，所以也不是很有关系的。不过我现在有点不知道该怎么办，我自己是不想要这本书的。
Right, she did get some nice presents, so it's no big deal. But I'm kind of unsure what to do now. I don't want to keep this book myself.

7.
If you don't want this one, you could swap it for something different. Are there any other books your friend might enjoy?
如果你不想要这一本，你可以换成别的。你朋友或许还喜欢什么别的书吗？

8.
我只知道她喜欢那本人物传记。至于她还爱看什么其他书，我还真的不知道。与其说绞尽脑汁也可能送不到她心仪的礼物，不如我请她去吃个广式早茶。
I just know she likes that biography. As for what other books she loves to read, I honestly don't know. Rather than racking my brains and possibly still failing to give her a gift she truly loves, I might as well take her out for dim sum.

9.
That's a lovely idea as well. So, I can process a refund for you on this book.
这主意也不错。那么我可以帮你把这本书退掉。

10.
谢谢你。我真没想到这本书她已经有了，看来办理退款是最合适的解决办法了。
Thank you. I really didn't expect she already had this book. Getting a refund seems like the best solution.

11.
Alternatively, you could choose a different book for yourself. If nothing else grabs your interest, just return here for a refund.
或者你也可以挑一本别的书给自己。如果没找到喜欢的，随时回来柜台给你退款。

12.
好的。我还有一个小时才得回去上班，所以我有时间慢慢挑。你能在这么棒的店工作，真让人羡慕呀！
Alright. I still have an hour before I go back to work, so I have time to browse slowly. I envy you for working in such a great store!

13.
Thanks. I adore my job. I'm passionate about books and guiding people to find books they'll enjoy. It's a perfect job for me.
谢谢。我很喜欢我的工作。我热爱书，也爱帮人挑到喜欢的书。这工作对我来说太合适了。

14.
我能感觉到你的热情！你真是位超级棒的店员呀。你们这里的服务也确实很棒。
I can feel your passion! You really are an amazing staff member. The service here is truly great.

#70208. Resolving Off-Plan Apartment Concerns - Business

1.
Morning, thanks for ringing in. What can I do for you today?
早上好，感谢致电。我今天能为您做些什么？

2.
您好，我在网上看到你们的网站，对地产方面有些疑问，想请您帮忙。
Hi, I came across your website online and have a few questions about property. I'd appreciate your help.

3.
Absolutely, we specialize in property law, and will do everything we can to sort out your issue.
当然可以，地产法是我们的专长，我们会尽全力帮您解决问题的。

4.
谢谢。我买了个公寓楼花，定金已经付了，可是现在我遇到大麻烦。我很焦虑，不知道怎么处理。
Thank you. I purchased an off-the-plan apartment and paid the deposit, but a serious issue has come up. I'm really anxious and don't know what to do.

5.
I totally understand. Buying real estate is a big investment, and even when things go smoothly, the process itself can be quite stressful.
我完全理解。买房是一笔大投资，就算一切顺利，过程本身也非常让人紧张。

6.
确实啊，事情不太顺利。昨天我刚和卖家签了合同。但是，我之后又发现了一些问题。
It's really not going well. I exchanged contracts with the seller just yesterday, but I believe there are some problems.

7.
Could you clarify the issues? Is it about the building itself, or maybe pet-related? We'll check the contract and resolve them for you.
您能具体说明是什么问题吗？是关于房屋本身的问题，还是宠物相关的问题？我们会查阅合同内容，为您解决问题。

8.
其实都不是。那些都没问题。我刚发现隔壁批准了一座新的公寓楼，从它那边正好能直接看到我的后院，这让我太不喜欢了。
Actually, neither. Those are all fine. I just found out they approved a new apartment building right next door that'll have a straight view into my backyard. I really don't like this at all.

9.
I understand. Since you signed only yesterday, you could invoke the cooling-off period clause to get your deposit back.
我明白了。既然您是昨天才签的合同，你可以利用合同中的冷静期条款，把定金拿回来。

10.
您能帮帮我吗？这几年我为了买房，节衣缩食地存钱，我承担不起这笔定金损失啊。
Can you please help me? I've been saving every penny for years to buy this property. I can't afford to lose this deposit!

11.
Certainly! I'd be glad to help. We can schedule an appointment to review the contract together. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
当然可以！乐意效劳。我们可以约个时间一起看看合同。您还有其他想聊的吗？

12.
我们明天见面，您有空吗？我会带着所有的文件的。谢谢您，真希望能尽快得到帮助。
Would you be available to meet tomorrow? I'll bring all the documents with me. Thank you. I really hope to get your help as soon as possible.

13.
Sure. How does 2 pm tomorrow work for you? We can go over your options then.
没问题。您看明天下午2点方便吗？到时候我们可以详细讨论您可选的方案。

14.
太好了！我的人生又有希望了！这个时间很合适。谢谢您！明天见！
That's fantastic! My life has hope again! This time works perfectly. Thank you! See you tomorrow!

#70207. Pitching Baked Goods to a Café - Business

1.
Welcome inside! I've got around half an hour before the morning rush hits. You said before you wanted to pitch your products?
请进！我还有大约半小时，之后就早高峰了。你之前说想给我推介一下你的产品？

2.
谢谢，我知道你们的咖啡店早上最忙，我不会耽误你太久的。
Thank you, I know your coffee shop is the busiest in the morning. I won't hold you up for too long.

3.
That's right. Most of our trade happens in the morning. Afternoons are pretty quiet. Folks around here tend to clock in and out early.
是啊，我们大部分的生意都集中在上午，下午就很冷清。这附近的人上下班都挺早的。

4.
我知道你的顾客大多是建筑工人和技工，我觉得他们会喜欢我的产品的。你需要多少，我都能供货。
I know most of your customers are construction workers and tradespeople, and I think they'll love my products. You name the quantity, and I can supply it.

5.
I'm always on the lookout for new offerings. I make my own sandwiches and salads, but I also source from suppliers like you.
我总是对新产品很感兴趣。我自己做三明治和沙拉，但也会从像您这样的供应商那里拿货。

6.
我很乐意每天给你送来新鲜的产品。我会根据你的热销产品，来调整供应的。
I'm happy to deliver fresh products daily. I can adjust my supply based on what sells best.

7.
That's amazing! You never know which product will be the hit. I'd love to hear more about what you offer.
太好了！你永远不知道哪款会成为热销品。我很想多了解一下你的产品。

8.
我擅长烘焙，尤其是蛋糕和饼干。这些食谱都是我祖母传下来的。
I specialize in baking, especially cakes and cookies—my recipes come straight from my grandmother.

9.
I see. You bake old-fashioned treats that spark childhood nostalgia. I think they'll be a hit.
我明白了。你做的是那种能唤起童年记忆的传统点心。我觉得它们肯定很受欢迎。

10.
是的，很多人都很喜欢我的食谱。我已经把业务拓展了，有了更大的店铺，生意还在不断增长。
Yes, lots of people love my recipes. I've expanded my business and got a bigger shop, and business keeps growing.

11.
Well, I think your products would fit my café perfectly. Can you come by with some samples this week?
嗯，我觉得你的产品会非常适合我的咖啡馆。你这周能带些样品过来吗？

12.
当然可以，没问题的。我会带上产品目录和批发价表。周四您方便吗？
Sure thing. No problem. I'll bring my product catalogue and wholesale price list. Is Thursday good for you?

13.
Thursday works great. My business partner will be here too, and we can decide then.
星期四很合适。我的生意合伙人那天也会在，我们那时候可以做决定。

14.
太好了。我很期待见到你的合伙人。谢谢你给我这个机会，周四见！
Great. I look forward to meeting your partner. Thanks for the opportunity—see you on Thursday!

#70206. Easy Ways to Pick Up Our Kids - Education

1.
Hi! It's good to see you! Come on in! Everyone's here already.
嗨，很高兴见到你！进来吧——大家都到了。

2.
你好，不好意思我迟到了，你今天组织了这么盛大的活动呀。
Hi, sorry I'm late. You've organized such a grand event today.

3.
Thank you! It's been a long time since we last met. I've been thinking of arranging an afternoon tea. I hope nothing bad happened to make you late?
谢谢！我们很久没见了。我一直想安排一次下午茶。希望你不是遇到什么麻烦才迟到的？

4.
不是，完全不是。我下午计划去学校接孩子放学，所以我走路去，又走路回来的。
No, not at all. I planned to pick up my kid from school this afternoon. So I walked there and back.

5.
Sounds like a great adventure! I've never tried walking there before. It must have taken you a long time to get there and back, right?
听起来像一次大冒险！我从来没走过。你来回一定要很久吧？

6.
嗯，比我预期的要久，但路并不难走。我从公园穿过去，没有沿着主路走。
Yeah, it took longer than I expected, but the route wasn't difficult. I cut through the park instead of taking the main road.

7.
I wish I could walk with my kids like that. But I've been swamped lately. Even driving to pick them up is tough.
我真希望能这样和孩子们一起走着上学。但最近我太忙了，连开车去接他们都难。

8.
我打算经常这样做。如果你愿意，这几天我可以帮你接孩子。下午我不上班，对我来说很方便。你就不用专门跑一趟学校了。
I plan to do this regularly. If you like, I can pick up your child for you over the next few days. I'm off work in the afternoons, so it's easy for me. You wouldn't have to make a special trip to the school.

9.
Wow, that would be a huge help! I'm sure my kids would enjoy walking! It's good exercise for them. As long as you don't mind, of course. I hope it's not a bother.
哇，这真帮大忙了。我肯定孩子们会喜欢走路！对他们锻炼身体也好。当然，只要你不介意就好，我不想给你添麻烦。

10.
没问题。我在之前的学校，和另外三个家长组了个小组，轮流拼车接孩子。现在趁大家都在，我们还可以问问其他家长是否愿意加入。
No problem. At my kid's previous school, three other parents and I formed a carpool group taking turns to pick up the kids. While everyone is here now, we could ask other parents if they'd like to join.

11.
I think that's a wonderful idea! I already know a few parents here who'd be interested in joining.
我觉得这是个很棒的主意! 我已经知道这里有几位家长会有兴趣加入的。

12.
好的，我们需要组织一下，这样每个人都能清楚安排。但我不太清楚该怎么开始。
Okay, we need to organize this so everyone knows the schedule. But I'm not quite sure how to get started.

13.
We need to first find out who's interested and set up a group chat on social media to organize these things.
我们需要先看看谁有兴趣，然后在社交媒体上建个群聊来组织这些事。

14.
太棒了，建群很简单，这样每个人就能清楚具体的安排了。
Perfect. Setting up a group is easy. Then everyone will know the exact plan.

#70205. Fixing a Faulty Laptop Under Warranty - Business

1.
Hi there! Thanks for stopping by our computer shop. What can I do for you today?
你好，欢迎光临我们的电脑店。请问今天有什么我能帮忙的吗？

2.
你好，我今天不是来买东西的。我的笔记本电脑出了点毛病。
Hi, I'm not here to buy anything today. My laptop's having some issues.

3.
That's totally fine. We offer diagnostics and repair services here. I'll definitely see what I can do for you.
没问题，我们这边有提供检查和维修服务。我肯定可以帮你看看。

4.
我把笔记本带过来了，是在你们店买的，可是它最近总是出问题，搞得我很头大。
I brought my laptop with me. I bought it from your store, but lately it keeps having problems. It's really frustrating.

5.
Got it. Good thing you brought it in. Did you happen to bring the receipt and the warranty card?
明白了，您带过来就对了。您带发票和保修卡了吗？

6.
有的，小票我带了，电脑也还在质保期。这台电脑，我买到现在还不到一年呢。
Yeah, I brought the receipt. It's still under warranty. I bought this computer less than a year ago.

7.
I see. Since it's still under warranty, it really shouldn't be having problems this early. It's a solid model.
了解，既然还在保修期，按理说不该这么快出问题。这款型号的电脑不错的。

8.
刚买的时候都还好，我很满意的。但是用了两三个星期之后，它就开始发烫了，我不得不关机。它还会开始随意自动关机。
It worked fine at first, and I was very happy with it. But after 2-3 weeks, it started getting too hot, so I had to turn it off. It even began shutting down by itself randomly.

9.
Yeah, laptops do get warm, depending on what you're doing, and your room temperature, but they shouldn't be overheating.
明白。笔记本在使用过程中会发热，跟工作内容和室温有关，但不该这么烫的。

10.
我用这个电脑处理商务文件的。无论什么资料，处理的时候都会丢失。这事搞得我很烦，我也不知道是哪出了问题。
I use this computer for business documents. Every time I work on files with it, they get lost. This is driving me crazy, and I can't figure out what's wrong.

11.
Oh, no! It might be a busted fan, a battery issue, or something on the software side. I'll have to take a look to know for sure.
哎呀！可能是风扇坏了，可能是电池问题，也可能是软件方面的故障。我得检查一下才能确定。

12.
那我是不是得把电脑放在这？我已经把文件都备份好了，我就是怕修电脑的时候资料会丢。
So I need to leave the laptop here, right? I've backed up everything already—I'm just worried something might get lost during the repair.

13.
Great. Yup, just leave it here with me. Once I figure out what's wrong, I'll give you a call.
太好了。对，把电脑留到我这就行，我找到问题就给你打电话。

14.
谢谢你啦，希望只是小毛病，我可不想再折腾一次啦。
Thanks, I really hope it's nothing serious. I really don't want to go through this hassle again.

#70204. Using Media and Web to Boost Food Donations - Business+Social

1.
Hey, thanks for getting here on such short notice. I'd like to go over our latest numbers with you.
嗨，感谢你这么早就到了。我想和你一起过一下我们最新的数据情况。

2.
没问题！我喜欢早点开始。我之前就希望我们这周能找个时间，深入聊聊这个事。
No problem! I like to start early. I was thinking we could schedule some time this week to really dig into this.

3.
We're now serving over twice the number of people compared to two years ago, and I'm honestly worried about keeping up.
我们现在帮助的人数是两年前的两倍多，说实话我有点担心我们能不能应付得来。

4.
确实，以前主要是老人和家庭，但现在越来越多年轻人也需要我们。
It's true — while we've traditionally served seniors and families, more young people are coming to us now.

5.
I guess many folks are struggling to cover basic groceries these days. Prices have really climbed.
我猜现在很多人都难以负担基本食材。物价确实涨得厉害。

6.
要是需求这么高下去，求助的人还是这么多，咱们的库存马上就耗光了，我不知道我们该怎么做。
If the demand keeps surging like this and we keep getting so many requests, we'll burn through our inventory soon. I don't know how to handle this.

7.
We've got to brainstorm ways to boost food donations from the public. I'm sure you've got some solid ideas.
咱们得想办法多提高公众的食物捐赠。我相信你肯定有好点子。

8.
我们可以发起社交媒体捐赠活动，还可以用新闻报道来宣传，呼吁大家多捐款和食物，来充实我们的食品库。
We could start a social media donation campaign and get news coverage to spread the word. Let's ask people to donate more money and food to stock up our food bank.

9.
If we can get the local TV station to cover this, we might even make the news. That would really help!
要是能让本地电视台报道一下，说不定还能上新闻呢，那就帮大忙了！

10.
好主意！借助新闻扩大影响力，能覆盖到比我们直接接触还更广泛的人群。
Good idea! Using news to expand influence can cover a wider crowd than we could reach directly.

11.
We could also add a page to our website explaining that volunteers run the pantry, so more funds go directly to food.
咱们还可以在官网上加个页面，说明食品库是志愿者运营的，这样更多钱就能直接买食物了。

12.
我们还可以在网站放上一些我们的照片，比如志愿者工作照，让人看到大家热心做事的样子。在这儿工作的人也会乐意一直帮助我们。
We could also post some photos on our website—like volunteers in action—to show people how passionate everyone is. The folks working here would be happy to keep helping out too!

13.
Love that! I really appreciate all you have done! None of this happens without your effort.
太棒了！我非常感激你所有的付出。要不是你，咱们这儿根本做不起来。

14.
收到感谢真的很有成就感！希望捐赠可以源源不断，这样我们就能帮到更多有需要的人啦。
It's so rewarding to be appreciated! Hopefully, the donations will keep coming so we can support more people in need.

#70203. Government Legal Helpline for Fence Dispute - Legal

1.
Good afternoon, you've reached the Law Information Helpline. What legal issue can I help you with today?
下午好，您已拨通法律信息热线，请问今天有什么法律问题我可以帮您解答？

2.
下午好，我这边有件事想请教，但不知道该怎么开口说起。
Good afternoon. I've got an issue I need help with, but I'm not sure how to get started.

3.
That's fine. I can explain your options and refer you to a lawyer who can take your case if you need one.
没问题——我可以给您提供一些信息，如果需要，我也能帮您推荐一位律师。

4.
能告诉我推荐的律师是谁吗？这样可能也不错。不过我想先了解一下推荐费是多少。
Could you tell me the lawyer's name? That sounds not bad—but first, I'd like to know how much a referral costs.

5.
Actually, we're a government service. Our legal information and referrals are free. You won't owe us a cent unless you engage a lawyer.
事实上，我们是政府部门，提供免费法律信息和推荐服务。只有您真的聘请律师，才会产生费用。

6.
哦，明白了。我现在也不确定需不需要律师，希望能免去这步，我实在不想上法庭。
Oh, got it. I'm not sure I need a lawyer—I really hope I can avoid this. I really don't want to go to court.

7.
It's a wise idea to avoid going to court if possible. Why don't you tell me about the details of your problem, and let's start from there?
避免上法庭确实是个明智的想法。您不如先跟我说说您的具体问题，我们从那儿开始？

8.
我和邻居在围栏问题上有分歧。他坚持让我出新围栏一半的费用，但我不同意。
I have a dispute with my neighbour over our fence. He insists I pay half the cost of a new fence, but I refuse.

9.
Could you explain why? It seems you have solid grounds for not wanting to split that cost.
能说说原因吗？听起来您有充足的理由不想分摊这笔费用。

10.
邻居家孩子整整几个小时对着围栏踢球，把围栏踢到严重损坏。我让他们停下，可他们根本不理。
Their kids have been kicking a ball against the fence for hours, leaving it badly damaged. I told them to stop, but they ignored me.

11.
There's a standard process for these disputes. If they damaged the shared fence, they're on the hook for the full cost of the new fence.
通常解决这类纠纷有固定流程：如果是他们造成的共有围栏损坏，就得由他们承担新栅栏的全部费用。

12.
噢！我没意识到这一点！这听起来很有希望啊。不过如果他们不配合，该怎么办呢？
Oh—I didn't realize that! That sounds promising. But what if they refuse to cooperate?

13.
The simplest route is to have a friendly chat with your neighbour and try to reach an agreement.
最简单的做法是先跟邻居好好沟通，看看能不能尽量达成一致。

14.
好，我会这样办的。希望能顺利解决，有需要我会再来电的。谢谢你！
All right—I'll do that. Hopefully it goes smoothly; if not, I'll call back. Thank you!

#70202. Soap Business Marketing Discussion - Business

1.
Hi. Nice to see you. You must be excited to start your new business.
嗨，很高兴见到你。你一定很激动要开始你的新生意吧。

2.
嗯，我打算开一个新生意。我已经有了一些初步的想法，但是还有一些细节需要想想。
Well, I'm planning to start a new business. I already have some initial ideas, but there are still some details to think about.

3.
Of course. I think there are still a lot of things to consider before going ahead. Tell me about your business ideas.
当然，我觉得在继续之前还有很多事情要考虑。告诉我你的商业想法吧。

4.
我打算开一个肥皂生意。我做肥皂好多年了，它们作为礼物很受欢迎。我现在打算出售肥皂。
I plan to start a soap business. I've been making soaps for many years—they're popular as gifts. Now I intend to sell soaps.

5.
All right. You have your product; you also have experience making them. You just need to organize the business aspects properly.
好的，你已经有产品了，也有制作经验。你只需把商业方面的事安排好就行了。

6.
没错，这就是我为什么来这儿。我想得到专业的帮助，找到最好的方法来卖肥皂。
Exactly. That's why I came here. I want professional help to find the best way to sell soap.

7.
I'm happy to help. Tell me more about your soap. What's special about it compared with other products on the market?
我很乐意帮助。跟我说说你的肥皂吧。它跟市面上的其他产品相比有什么特别之处？

8.
嗯，这是一种不同的肥皂。它是专门针对狗狗的。市场上有很多狗狗香波，但肥皂不多。
Well, this is a different soap. It's specially made for dogs. There are many dog shampoos on the market, but not many soaps.

9.
That's a surprise. I didn't expect dogs would be your top market. Do you know why dog owners would choose your products?
真让我惊讶。我没想到狗狗会是你的主要市场。你知道为什么狗主人会选你的产品吗？

10.
这个肥皂是用天然材质制作的，没有化学物质、没有添加剂。里面还加入了精油成分，让狗狗闻起来更清新。
This soap is made with natural materials, with no chemicals or additives. It also contains essential oils to make dogs smell fresher.

11.
OK. I will create a marketing plan and add a few points based on what we discussed before. I just need to do some research first.
好的。我会制定一个营销计划，并根据我们之前讨论的内容补充几点。我只不过需要先做些调研。

12.
太好了。我接下来一两周需要这个计划。我已经有了售卖计划，希望你有足够的时间。
Great. I'll need this plan in the next week or two. I already have a selling plan—hope you'll have enough time.

13.
Yes, that timeline works for me. You'll also need a website. If you don't have one yet, I can include some options in the plan.
好的，这个时间表对我来说没问题。你还需要一个网站。如果还没有，我可以在方案里加一些选项。

14.
一定要，请你一定要加上。这会很有帮助。我还有很多事要做。
Definitely. Please make sure to include it. That'd be really helpful. I still have a lot to do.

Come in. Have a seat. Thank you for coming to the interview. Are you interested in joining us?
请进。坐吧。谢谢你来面试。你有兴趣加入我们吗？

2.
谢谢。我很想在这里工作。贵公司有很好的声誉。
Thanks. I really want to work here. Your company has a very good reputation.

That's good to hear. We are a top company in the industry. Making sure our clients and employees are happy is very important to us.
听到这个我很高兴。我们是行业顶尖的公司。确保我们的客户和员工都满意对我们非常重要。

4.
如果我能得到这份工作就太好了。我想我一定会在这里工作得很开心。但是我知道你们对这份工作有一些法律要求。
It would be wonderful if I could get this job. I think I would be very happy working here. But I know you have some legal requirements for this position.

5.
Yes. We currently have license requirements. We need you to have the correct license before offering you this job.
是的。目前我们对驾照有要求。在聘用您之前，我们需要您持有合适的驾照。

6.
我明白了。我知道你们要检查驾照和驾驶记录。我开车很多年了，记录很好，从来没有任何罚单和事故。
I understand. I know you'll check my license and driving record. I've been driving for many years, with a clean record and no tickets or accidents.

7.
Excellent. That's good. We prefer our drivers to have some driving experience, and we only hire drivers with clean records.
太好了。这很好。我们偏好有驾驶经验的司机，而且只雇用记录良好的司机。

8.
我不清楚你们想让我开什么类型的车。我有普通汽车的驾照，也有卡车驾照。
I'm not clear on what type of vehicle you want me to drive. I have a regular car license, and I also have a truck license.

9.
We need a driver who can drive a truck. We just signed a contract with another company, so we urgently need to find the right driver.
我们需要一名能开卡车的司机。我们刚与另一家公司签了合同，所以急需合适的司机。

10.
我猜你们需要我开卡车。我有开卡车的经验。我之前和另一位候选人聊过，他没有卡车驾照。
I guess you need me to drive a truck. I do have truck-driving experience. I spoke with another candidate earlier—he doesn't have a truck license.

11.
That's great. I think you have a great chance for this job. You have this type of experience that we are looking for.
太好了。我觉得您很有机会得到这份工作。您正好有我们需要的那种经验。

#70200. Social Media Strategies for Selling Art - Business

1.
Hi! Welcome to our Business Support Open Day. How can I assist you today?
你好！欢迎参加我们的生意支持开放日，我今天有什么可以帮你的吗？

2.
你好。我是一名画家。我今天过来是想获得一些怎么拓宽销售渠道的建议。
Hi. I'm an artist and I've come here today looking for advice on how to broaden my sales channels.

3.
That's wonderful! Do you already have any of your pieces on the market?
太好了！您已经在市面上出售作品了吗？

4.
是的，我一般会在本地集市摆摊卖画，不过销售情况时好时坏。
Yes. I usually set up a stall at the local market to sell my work, but my sales are quite inconsistent.

5.
Got it. Have you tried selling your work through galleries? It's an approach many artists take.
明白了。您尝试过在画廊销售吗？许多艺术家都会这样做。

6.
这一点我其实也想到过。我有联系过几家画廊的。但是，他们抽的佣金实在太高了，就会导致我的利润很少。
I've actually thought about that before. I've reached out to a few galleries, but their commission rates are so high and it leaves me with barely any profit.

7.
I totally get that. Gallery commissions are no joke. They can be really steep. Have you ever thought about selling your work online? Online sales are booming right now.
我完全能理解。画廊抽成可不是闹着玩的，能贵到离谱。您有没有想过把销售转到网上呢？现在网上销售也很火。

8.
网上销售？我听说过，但是我没什么这方面的经验。您是指通过专门的平台或者网站吗？
Online sales? I've heard about it. But I don't have much experience with that. Do you mean specific platforms or websites?

9.
Well, you might want to begin by using social media platforms to connect with a broader audience. Plus, your buyers can get full transparency on what they're purchasing.
嗯，您或许可以先从社交媒体平台入手，来接触更广泛的受众。另外，你的买家也能非常透明地看到他们买的是什么。

10.
这个建议太棒了。在线上，客户能全方位看到我的作品，肯定更吸引人。我家里的油画和素描现在都堆成山了，根本没地方放了。
This advice is amazing! When clients can get the full perspective of my work online, that would be more appealing. My oil paintings and sketches are just piling up at home now with nowhere to go.

11.
You can also engage directly with potential buyers with the help of social media. Also, you can post updates whenever you want and showcase new work on a regular basis.
社交媒体还能让您直接跟潜在买家互动。而且，您可以随时发布更新和经常展示新作品。

12.
听上去很棒。在社交媒体上发帖，对我来说其实并不是那么复杂。但是我估计需要花点时间积累粉丝和互动。
That sounds amazing. Posting on social media isn't actually that complicated for me, but I guess it'll take some time to build a following and get engagement.

13.
I believe you'll nail it! Also, if you want to plan an exhibition or special event down the line, you can promote it via social channels too.
我相信你能做到的！而且，以后如果您想办个展览或特别活动，你也能用社媒渠道来宣传。

14.
谢谢你的夸奖！今天你给了我很多可行的思路和信心，真的是帮了我大忙！
Thank you for your kind words. You've given me a lot of practical ideas and confidence today. This has really helped me a lot!

#70199. Parent's Call for Disability Holiday Program Details - Social

1.
Hi. You have reached the Disability Support Program hotline. How may I assist you today?
下午好，您已拨通残疾人支持项目热线，请问今天有什么我可以帮忙的吗？

2.
你好，我是孩子的家长，最近听说了你们的一个为残疾儿童设计的假期项目，我想了解更多详细情况。
Hello, I am the parent of a child, and I recently heard about your holiday program designed for children with disabilities. I would like to learn more details.

3.
I'd be happy to help. I'm one of the coordinators for this program. Could you tell me how you found out about it?
我很乐意帮忙，我是这个项目的协调员之一。请问您是怎么得知这个项目的呢？

4.
我儿子在一家医院参加体育训练。就在这个礼拜，我在医院的公告板上注意到了一张你们介绍这个假期项目的海报。
My son is currently taking part in sports training at a hospital, and just this week, I noticed a poster on the hospital notice board about your holiday program.

5.
I'm glad that you noticed the poster. We don't promote it broadly since our support is limited to a few families annually.
我很高兴您看到了那个海报。我们不大范围宣传，因为每年我们只能帮助少数几个家庭。

6.
我懂的。现在我想清楚点了解一下这个残疾儿童假期计划是怎么运作的。因为海报上明确写着，这个假期完全免费的。
I understand. Now, I would like to clearly know how this holiday program for children with disabilities operates, as the poster clearly states that this holiday is completely free of charge.

7.
There's indeed no charge. We provide a spacious house by the beach free of cost. It can accommodate two families simultaneously.
确实不需要支付任何费用。我们会免费提供一栋很大的靠近海滩的房子，可以同时容纳两个家庭。

8.
那真是太好了！我儿子特别喜欢海滩。但是我们家有四口人，如果能安排两间房间，就再合适不过了。
That's really great! My son especially loves beaches. But there are four of us in the family, having two bedrooms would be just perfect.

9.
Every family is assigned two bedrooms along with its own private bathroom. We also supply food for shared cooking and dining, which gives you the chance to connect with new people.
每个家庭都会配备两间卧室和独立的浴室。我们还会提供食材，让大家可以一起做饭和就餐，这样你们有机会认识新朋友。

10.
太好了。这样的话，我们就有机会认识其他的家庭了！我儿子也能认识一些能理解他的情况和一起分享相似经历的朋友。
That's great. That way, we will have the opportunity to connect with other families, and my son can make friends with those who understand his situation and share similar experiences.

11.
He can make new friends so sure, and you'll also get support from fellow parents. Would you like to proceed with the application now?
他一定会交到新朋友，您也能从其他家长那里获得支持。您现在要办理申请吗？

12.
要的，非常感谢。我已经好久没有和家人一起度假了，希望这个申请过程不要太繁琐，让我们可以轻松享受这次假期。
Yes, thank you very much. I haven't taken a family vacation for a long time, and I hope this application process won't be too complicated so that we can easily enjoy the holiday.

13.
It won't be at all. It's very simple, with just a single form to fill out. Once you complete it, we'll contact you to schedule your holiday date.
一点也不复杂的。非常简单。只需要填写一张表格。您一填完表，我们就联系您确定度假日期。

14.
非常感谢您的帮助。我真的很期待这次假期，我儿子也肯定会非常兴奋的。也感谢您组织了这么棒的项目。
Thank you so much for your help. I'm really looking forward to this holiday; my son is definitely going to be very excited. And thank you for organizing such a wonderful program.

#70198. Flight Change Request After New Job Start - Tourism+Business

1.
Good afternoon, thank you for calling our Airline Customer Service. How may I assist you today?
下午好，感谢您致电我们航司客服部，今天有什么可以帮您的吗？

2.
下午好，我想咨询一下我下个月航班的事情，我有一些疑问。
Good afternoon, I'd like to make an enquiry about my flight next month. I have a few questions.

3.
Absolutely! Thank you for flying with us. I'd be glad to answer any questions you have about your reservation.
当然！感谢您乘坐我们的航班。我很乐意为您解答有关预订的任何问题。

4.
大概三个月前，我在你们官网订了票，并且已经付款了。现在我想更改预定，但是我不太清楚流程。
I booked and paid for my ticket on your website about three months ago. I'd like to change my reservation now, but I'm not sure how to proceed.

5.
Sure thing. I'm happy to help! Could you give me your flight details so I can check what options are available?
当然可以。我很乐意帮忙！能告诉我您的航班信息吗？我来看看有哪些可行的方案。

6.
本来我是打算去度假的，可我刚入职一个新工作，现在请不了假。
I planned to go on vacation, but I just started a new job and can't take time off now.

7.
Congrats on your new position! I'm sorry you won't make the trip—that's really unfortunate.
恭喜您找到新工作！很遗憾您度假度不成了，太不巧了。

8.
是的，我也没想好该怎么办。我正在考虑要么改期，要么退票取消预定。
Yes, I haven't decided what to do yet. I'm thinking either to push the flight to a later date or cancel and get a refund.

9.
Alright. When do you think you might get leave? Some tickets can be rescheduled or canceled, but fees may apply.
好的。您估计您什么时候能休假？有些票可以改期或者取消，但可能会收取一些费用。

10.
我知道会有些额外费用，希望不要太贵。我还不确定能休假的确切时间，需要跟我的新雇主商量一下。他说过年底应该可以请假。
I know there will be extra fees—hopefully not too expensive. I don't have a firm leave date yet; I need to discuss it with my new employer, who said I could take time off by year's end.

11.
It depends on your fare class, but fees are usually modest. You'll get refunded the balance after cancellation. You probably need to act soon and read the terms of your ticket carefully. Some discounted tickets aren't changeable.
这要看您的票种，不过一般手续费不高。取消后差额会退还。您可能得尽快操作，并仔细阅读机票的条款。有些特价票不能更改。

12.
好的，我回去看看我机票的种类，再给你回电。你们网站上能查到这些信息吗？
Okay, I'll check my fare type and call you back. Is that info available on your website?

13.
Yes. You can find all terms and fees on our site. If anything's unclear, feel free to call back.
没问题，您可以在我们网站上查看所有条款和费用。如有疑问，您尽管给我们打电话。

14.
好的，我会上网查一下怎么处理，权衡权衡这些选择。谢谢你的帮助！
Alright, I'll go online to see how to handle this and weigh my options. Thanks for your help!

#70197. Police Call About House Invasion - Legal

1.
Hi. You've reached the Australian Police Assistance Hotline. This is Officer Williams speaking. How may I be of service today?
你好，你已拨通澳大利亚警察求助热线，我是警官威廉姆斯。今天有什么可以为你效劳的吗？

2.
警察同志你好。我家突然有人闯进来了，我现在完全不知道该怎么办才好。
Hello, officer. Someone broke into my house, and I really have no idea what to do now.

3.
Alright, the most important thing is your safety. First, ensure you're okay and if anyone is still inside, please stay out.
好的，最重要的是确保您的安全。首先，确认您没事，如果家里还有人，请不要进去。

4.
目前家里已经没有人了。我刚到家时发现房里空荡荡的没人，但明显看得出之前有人来过。太吓人了。
Now there's nobody inside. I just got home and found the place empty with no one inside, but it's clear someone was there earlier. It's so scary.

5.
I see. Please try to keep calm and start from the beginning. Can you explain what happened?
我明白。请尽量保持冷静，从头开始跟我说说到底发生了什么？

6.
好的，我尽量平复一下我的情绪吧。我刚刚旅游回来，发现家里被翻得乱七八糟。而且，洗衣房的窗户被砸破了！
Okay, I'll try to calm down. I just got back from a trip and found my home completely ransacked. The laundry room window also got smashed!

7.
It appears they gained entry by smashing the laundry room window. I know this situation is chaotic, but could you check if anything has been stolen?
他们可能是通过砸破洗衣房的窗户闯进去的。我知道情况很混乱，但你能否确认一下有没有东西被盗走？

8.
哎呀，我还没来得及细看所有的东西呢，因为我第一时间就打电话给你们了。不过，我发现电视和立体声音响不见了，而且还有一台电脑也没了。
Oh boy. I haven't had the chance to look over everything in detail since I called you immediately. However, I noticed the TV is gone, the stereo is gone, and a computer is missing.

9.
Alright, please refrain from tidying up or touching anything at the scene. I'll dispatch an officer to your residence so you can file a report regarding the stolen items.
好的，请不要清理或碰动现场的任何东西。我会派一名警官到您家，让您报案记录被盗物品的情况。

10.
天啊，我真是难以置信会有人做出这种事。虽然我家里没有特别贵重的东西，但要重新买回这些东西还是很麻烦啊。
Oh my god. I really can't believe someone would do something like this. Even though I don't have any highly valuable items at home, replacing these things is still a hassle.

11.
If your home and belongings are insured, your insurance should help cover the cost of replacing the stolen items. Also, could you check if anything else is missing?
如果您的房屋和物品都有保险，保险应该可以帮您赔偿更换被盗的物品。另外，您能再确认一下是否还有别的东西被偷了吗？

12.
对对对，我竟然忘了我还有保险！保险肯定能帮上忙。要是可以的话，我想等警察来了以后，我再详细检查整个房子。
Oh right! I can't believe I forgot about my insurance! It definitely should help. If possible, I'd prefer to check the entire house carefully after the police arrive.

13.
Definitely, it's a smart idea to wait inside your car until the police show up so nothing gets disturbed. It won't take much time.
当然，最好是在车里等到警察到达，这样可以确保不破坏现场。时间不会太久的。

14.
非常感谢你们帮忙。回家看到这种情况，真是我最不想遇到的。你们的帮助实在是救了我一命啊。
Thank you so much for your help. This is the last thing I ever wanted to see when I got home, your assistance has truly been a lifesaver.

#70196. Pharmacist Advice for Flu-Like Symptoms - Medical

1.
Hi, you seem a bit under the weather. What can I do for you?
嗨，你看上去好像身体不太舒服。有什么我能帮忙的吗？

2.
是呀。我很难受。我女儿大概从一周前就开始咳嗽了，现在我也咳嗽起来了，我感觉我好像也感染了同一种病毒。
Yes, I feel unwell. About a week ago, my daughter started coughing, and now I'm coughing too. I feel like I've caught the same virus.

3.
Oh dear, there's quite a potent virus circulating these days, and many people have already been hit by it.
哎呀，最近有一种很厉害的病毒在传播，已经影响到很多人了。

4.
医生说我女儿不用吃药，只要呆在家休息，不去上学就行。她现在已经恢复了，不过我病得比她严重，感觉特别难受。
The doctor said my daughter doesn't need any medication and should just stay home instead of going to school. She's recovered now, but I'm much sicker than her and feel really awful.

5.
Well, kids usually bounce back from viral infections more quickly than adults. I'm sorry you've caught it too. It's quite unfortunate. This virus can be quite contagious.
孩子通常比大人更快从病毒感染中恢复。很遗憾你也感染了。太不幸了。这个病毒传染性很强。

6.
没错，这病毒的传染性实在是太强了。你能不能帮我开点药，让我感觉好一点呢？
Yeah, this virus is so contagious. Could you prescribe some medication to help me feel a bit better?

7.
Unfortunately, no medicine can cure a viral infection outright. The virus usually has to run its course while your body heals on its own, which can take a while.
遗憾的是，没有任何药物能直接治愈病毒感染。通常病毒需要靠你身体自己恢复，这可能得花一段时间。

8.
我感觉是实在太糟了，全身酸痛，就连躺在床上也觉得疼。而且，我还发烧了。
I feel really terrible; my whole body aches and even lying in bed is painful. I also have a fever.

9.
I understand. Although I can't directly prescribe medicine here, I can definitely recommend some over-the-counter options that may help lower your fever and let you sleep better.
我明白。虽然我不能直接给你开药，但我完全可以推荐一些非处方药，它们可能可以帮你退烧，让你睡得更好些。

10.
太好了，发烧真是太难熬了。一开始我觉得特别冷，接着出了好多汗，热得要命。而且我的喉咙也很痛。刀割一样疼。
That's great, having a fever is really awful. At first, I felt really cold, and then I broke out in a heavy sweat. It was unbearably hot. Plus, my throat is hurting so badly, it feels like it's being sliced with a knife.

11.
You might try some throat lozenges that might ease your sore throat. You could also try some steam inhalation, which can help soothe your cough.
你可以试试含点含片，可能会缓解你的喉咙痛。你也可以试试吸蒸汽，有助于缓解咳嗽。

12.
好的，我试试。非常感谢你。我真希望我能快点好，我不能一直待在家里，耽误上班了。
Alright, I'll give that a try. Thanks a lot. I really hope I can get better soon. I can't keep staying home and missing work.

13.
Yes, while the medicine won't tackle the virus itself, it should definitely help with the symptoms. I hope you feel better soon and can get back to work.
是的，虽然药物不能直接治好病毒，但肯定能缓解你的症状。希望你快点好起来，能回去上班。

14.
非常感谢你的帮助。生病真是太麻烦了，总让人觉得特别难受，我真心希望能尽快恢复正常。
Thank you so much for your help. Being sick is such a hassle. It always makes you feel terrible. I truly hope to get back to normal as soon as possible.

Good morning. I really appreciate you taking the time to come to the office to meet me today.
早上好。感谢你今天抽空来办公室和我见面。

2.
早上好啊。没事的。能见到你和团队的其他人，我很开心。
Good morning. It's okay. I'm really glad to see you and the other members of the team.

3.
That's good to know. I'd like to have a quick chat with you about how your work-from-home setup is coming along. How are things going so far?
那挺好的。我想跟你简单聊聊你在家办公的安排情况。目前都还好吗？

4.
目前都挺好的。虽然我很想念你们，但是不用每天跑办公室上班，真的是帮我省了不少的通勤时间啊！
So far, so good. Although I really miss you all, not having to rush over to the office every day has really saved me a lot of commuting time!

5.
Well, we miss having you around as well, but it's great to know you're enjoying working from home. I understand how much it matters to you.
嗯，我们也很想念跟你一起工作。不过，了解到你喜欢居家办公真是太好了。我理解这对你来说很重要。

6.
是呀。不用再花两个小时在通勤上，真的给我带来了很大的变化。我现在感觉精力充沛了不少。
Yes, not having to spend two hours commuting has made a huge difference. I feel much more energetic now.

7.
That's wonderful to hear. But I've been informed by the IT Department that you've encountered some technical problems recently.
真是太好了。不过，信息技术部跟我说你最近遇到了一些技术问题。

8.
是呀，我家里的网络状况不是很好，尤其是在高峰时段，网速很慢，有时甚至会崩溃。
Yes, my internet connection isn't very good, especially during peak hours: it gets really slow and sometimes it even crashes.

9.
I noticed that you get disconnected from online meetings occasionally, though I wasn't aware that it was due to technical glitches.
我注意到线上会议时你偶尔会掉线，但我不知道这是技术故障造成的。

10.
唉。我试过把路由器放到家里的每一个角落，但是都没有用。技术人员建议更换一台新设备，还要升级到更快的套餐。
Ah, I've tried placing the router in every corner of the house, but nothing worked. The technician suggested replacing it with a new device and upgrading to a faster plan.

11.
I see. We'll arrange to get you a new network device and switch you over to a higher-level plan.
我了解了。我们会给你更换一台新的网络设备，并且帮你升级到一个更高级的套餐。

12.
好的。我都开始担心这些问题会影响我的工作效率和工作量了，技术故障真是让人头疼啊！
Okay. I'm starting to worry that these issues will affect my work efficiency and workload; technical glitches are such a headache!

13.
Don't worry. I'll talk with the appropriate team, and once we have the go-ahead, I'll let you know. You're also welcome to reach out to them directly to get it resolved.
别担心。我会跟相关团队沟通，一批下来就通知你。你也可以直接联系他们解决。

14.
太好了。我真的非常感激你帮我解决这个问题。我希望能尽快恢复到正常的工作状态。
That's great. I truly appreciate your help in resolving this issue. I hope to get back to normal work as soon as possible.

#70194. Phone Inquiry about Electric Bike Rules - Legal+Business

1.
Hi, you've reached the police station. Are you calling about an emergency or do you need to report something non-urgent?
你好，这里是警局。您是因为紧急情况来电，还是有非紧急事件需要报案呢？

2.
你好，我没有紧急情况。我有点犹豫，不知道如果我不是来报案的，打个电话咨询一下是不是可以？
Hello, I don't have an emergency. I'm a bit hesitant about whether it's okay to call just to ask a question when I'm not reporting an incident.

3.
Don't worry about calling. During emergencies, we might be tied up, but it's quiet at the moment. I'm here to help.
电话咨询没问题。如果碰到紧急情况，我们可能忙不过来。不过，现在不忙。我很乐意帮忙。

4.
谢谢你。我儿子让我给他买一辆电动自行车。这样，他去朋友家就更方便了。但是，我不太放心。
Thank you. My son asked me to buy him an electric bike so that it is more convenient for him to go to his friend's place. But I'm a bit worried.

5.
Well, electric bikes have become very popular among teenagers, and parents love them as well, since they no longer have to drive their kids around.
嗯，电动自行车很受青少年欢迎，家长也很喜欢，因为这样他们就不用开车接送孩子了。

6.
对，我愿意给儿子买。但是，我对电动自行车的道路规定有些疑问。我试着在网上查了查，但是我感觉那些信息不是特别清楚。
Yes, I am willing to buy one for my son. But I have some questions about the road rules for electric bikes. I tried checking online, but I felt that the information was not very clear.

7.
Electric bikes follow the same general road rules as push bikes, but there are also a few special rules just for them.
电动自行车和普通自行车一样，都适用一般的道路规则。不过它们也有一些专门的规定。

8.
原来是这样。我不太清楚，我儿子骑电动自行车的话，是不是要像骑摩托车那样，需要考驾照。
I see. I'm not sure if my son needs to get a driver license to ride an electric bike, just like riding a motorcycle.

9.
No, he doesn't need one. Even though both vehicles have motors, they're categorized differently. Electric bikes don't need a license or insurance.
不，不需要。虽然这两种车都有电机，但是它们的类别不同。电动自行车不需要驾照或保险。

10.
我明白了，这样确实能简单点儿。不过，我在给儿子买电动自行车之前，还得考虑很多问题，毕竟，市面上电动自行车的选择实在太多了。
I see. That definitely makes things a bit simpler. However, there are still many factors to consider before buying him an electric bike. After all, there are so many options out there.

11.
Absolutely, there are plenty of options. I believe a dealer can really offer you some solid advice on picking the right electric bike.
确实，选择非常多。我觉得，经销商能给你一些挑选合适电动车的有用建议。

12.
有道理。我会确保我儿子熟悉电动自行车的道路规则的。我也会买一辆符合规定的车给他。
That makes sense. I will make sure my son is familiar with the road rules for electric bikes. I will also buy him a bike that meets the rules.

13.
Great, that's good to know. You can always check the government transportation website for all the road safety rules. I hope your son has fun riding and stays safe.
听到这个我很高兴。你可以在政府交通网站上查到所有道路安全规定。希望你儿子骑得开心，也能注意安全。

14.
太感谢了。警察同志，你真的是帮了我大忙。我非常感激你的耐心解答。这次通话解决了我的很多疑问。
Thank you so much. Officer, you have really helped me a lot. I really appreciate how patiently you answered my questions. This call has resolved many of my questions.

#70193. Talking Through a Retirement Plan - Business

1.
Morning! Thanks a lot for calling in. What can I help you with today?
早上好，谢谢你打电话来。我今天能帮你点什么？

2.
你好呀，我想聊聊我的退休计划，可以吗？我最近一直在考虑这个问题。
Hey there! I was hoping to talk about my retirement plan—if that's okay? It's just something that's been on my mind lately.

3.
Of course! That's exactly what I do. I help people with retirement planning. It's super important to have enough saved up so you can live comfortably once you stop working.
当然可以啦，我专门做这个的。我帮大家做退休规划。存够钱很重要，这样退休后才能过得舒舒服服的。

4.
对，我想管理好开支，退休以后能有更多时间去做现在没空做的事。
Yeah, I want to keep my expenses under control and have more time in retirement to do the things I don't really get to do right now.

5.
Yeah, totally. The earlier you plan, the better. Plus, it's better to keep checking in on your plan, because your situation and needs are always changing.
没错，越早开始规划越好。而且，最好时不时检查一下计划，因为你的情况和需求一直会变。

6.
我以前确实没太考虑这些事。不过，现在离退休不远了。我觉得要重新整理一下了。
I hadn't really thought about this before. But as I get closer to retirement age, I think it's time to revisit my plan.

7.
Absolutely. This isn't something you just set up once and forget about. But I'll make it easier for you. So: where do you want to start?
当然了，这不是那种一次搞定就能不管的事。不过我会帮您把过程简化。那您想先从哪块儿说起？

8.
我不知道自己到底该存多少钱。我看新闻和媒体都有讲这方面的事，我挺担心自己的积蓄不够用。
I'm not really sure how much money I need to save. I see news and media talking about this, and I'm pretty worried my savings won't cut it.

9.
That's a common concern that many people share. I hear folks throw out some figures all the time. But honestly, it all depends on your own goals. What you need might be totally different from someone else.
是啊，很多人都会担心这件事。我经常听到有人随口提一些数字。但说实话，这完全取决于你自己的目标——每个人的需求可能完全不同。

10.
说得有道理。我得先搞清楚我想过什么样的退休生活，才能对症下药地规划。
That makes sense. I need to figure out what kind of retirement life I really want so I can plan accordingly.

11.
Exactly. Once you've got a clear picture of what you need, I can help you figure out how to get there step by step.
完全正确。一旦你搞清楚了自己需要什么，我就能一步步帮你规划达成目标的方案。

12.
我挺开心能终于开始动手整理我的退休理财了。毕竟，我已经有一段时间没管这个问题了。
I'm really glad I'm finally doing something about my retirement finances. After all, I've been ignoring it for a while.

13.
That's a solid first step. I can also send you a few forms to help you think through what things you'll need to take into account when planning.
这是很棒的第一步。我还可以发你一些表格，帮你理清在做计划时要考虑的点。

14.
好的。最好能在我下一次预约之前，把表格发过来。我想先看看内容，再决定怎么继续，这样会比较安心。多谢你。
Sounds good. It would be great if you could send those forms over before I book the next session. I'd feel more comfortable looking things over first before I decide how to move forward. Thanks a lot.

#70192. Discussing a Film Festival with the City Council - Social

1.
Hey there, welcome to the council hall! What brings you here today?
你好，欢迎来到市政厅！今天有什么能帮您的？

2.
下午好！我来是想问问我正在策划的一个社区活动。
Good afternoon, I'd like to ask about the community event I'm organizing.

3.
Of course! Can you give me more details about the event? How do you think the city council can help?
没问题！可以多给我讲讲这个活动吗？你觉得市政厅能怎么帮你？

4.
是这样的，我发现最近有一些新移民搬到这里，我想通过组织一个活动，向他们介绍澳大利亚的文化。
Well, I've noticed that some new migrants have moved in recently, so I'd like to organize an event to showcase Australian culture.

5.
Wow! We're always happy to welcome new migrants from different parts of the world who have settled in this area. I think this is a fantastic idea.
哇！我们一直很欢迎来自世界各地的新移民搬到这个社区定居。我觉得这个想法真的太棒了。

6.
谢谢你！我想咨询一下，能不能租下社区大厅一周？我打算办一个小型的澳大利亚电影节。
Thank you! I'd like to know if I can hire the community hall for a week. I'm planning to hold a small Australian film festival.

7.
You can rent the community hall for an entire week, but it will depend on the schedule and whether the space is available.
您可以租用社区大厅一整周，但这取决于时间安排和场地是否空闲。

8.
我了解了。我计划六个月以后举办电影节。为了拿到批准，我可真是费了不少工夫啊。
I got it. I'm planning to hold the film festival in six months. Getting the approval for it really took me quite a lot of effort.

9.
I'm sure putting this event together takes a lot of effort, but it sounds fantastic. I believe many people will love it.
筹备这个活动肯定需要不少工夫。但听起来真的很棒。我相信会有很多人喜欢的。

10.
只要场地确定下来，我就可以开始在本地做宣传了。我希望能吸引更多人来参加。
Once the venue is confirmed, I can start promoting it locally. I hope to attract more people to join.

11.
The council might be able to assist with promotion. Our local engagement team can help with that. This is a wonderful event.
可能市政厅可以帮你宣传。我们的本地推广团队可以帮忙。这个活动很棒。

12.
太感谢了！我真的希望活动能办得成功。市政厅的宣传支持对我来说帮助很大，能吸引更多人来参与。
Thank you so much! I really hope the event will be a success. The council's support in promotion is a big help to me, and it will attract more people to participate.

13.
How about coming over to meet the events team? They'll be available tomorrow, so you can finalize the venue and go over the advertising details.
要不要过来见见活动团队？他们明天有空，你可以确认场地，并商量宣传的细节。

14.
太棒了！我明天整天都有空，那就明天见咯！谢谢你的帮助，期待和团队见面！
That's great! I'm free all day tomorrow, so I'll see you then! Thanks for your help, and I'm looking forward to meeting the team!

#70191. Navigating Customer Service Challenges - Business

1.
Hi, great to see you! Come on in and have a seat. I wanted to check: how's the new job treating you?
嗨，见到你真高兴！快进来坐吧。我想问问，你的新工作怎么样？

2.
很好，谢谢！最近工作挺忙的，不过我喜欢这种忙碌的感觉，这样上班时间会过得特别快。
It's going really well, thanks! Work's been pretty hectic lately, but I enjoy staying busy. It really makes the workday fly by.

3.
Yeah, I get that. I had a chat with your supervisor, and he mentioned that you're doing great and picking things up really fast.
是啊，我理解。我和你的主管聊过，他说你表现得很棒，学东西也特别快。

4.
我很高兴他对我的工作满意。毕竟我已经干了几个星期了，现在感觉越来越有自信了。
I'm really glad to hear that he's happy with my work. After all, I've been here for a few weeks now, so I'm starting to feel more confident.

5.
The more you interact with customers, the more confident you'll get. Providing good customer service is key.
接触的顾客越多，你的信心就会越足。高质量的客户服务很重要。

6.
确实。我很喜欢跟顾客交流，帮他们找到最好的解决方案。但说实话，这并不简单。
Absolutely. I really enjoy talking to customers and figuring out the best way to help them. But honestly, it's not always easy.

7.
So true. Even if a business has a great system in place, issues still pop up. And when they do, customers tend to get even more frustrated. Have you run into any tough situations?
没错。就算生意的运营流程很好，还是会出现问题。一旦有问题，顾客往往会更不高兴。你遇到过难处理的情况吗？

8.
是的。有人把本该打折的商品按原价卖给了顾客。那位女士回家后才发现，她非常郁闷。
Yeah. Someone charged a customer full price for something that was supposed to be discounted. The customer didn't realize it until she got home, and she was really upset.

9.
Oh no! I can totally see why she'd be mad: it must've been such a hassle for her. I hope you were able to sort it out.
哎呀！我完全能理解她为什么生气，这对她来说肯定很麻烦。希望你已经把问题解决了。

10.
是的，我纠正了这个错误，退还了差价。但她还是很生气，我真不知道还能怎么做。
Yeah, I fixed the mistake and refunded the price difference. But she was still pretty upset, and I wasn't sure what else I could do.

11.
In situations like that, you could offer her a discount voucher for her next purchase. Just be sure to check with your supervisor first.
遇到这种情况，你可以给她一张下次购物的折扣券。不过要先跟你主管确认一下。

12.
哦！我明白了。如果当时我给她折扣券，她可能就有不一样的反应了。我知道她是我们的常客。
Oh! I see. If I had given her a discount voucher at the time, she might have reacted differently. I know she's a regular customer.

13.
Exactly! Keeping returning customers happy is super important. The last thing we want is a bad review online.
没错！让回头客满意真的太重要了。我们最不想看到的就是网上的差评。

14.
明白了。要是没处理好，可能会影响不好。我很高兴我现在知道该怎么给客户多多提供帮助了。
Got it. If things aren't handled well, they could have a negative impact. I'm really glad I now know how to go the extra mile for customers.

#70190. From Crib to Platform Bed - Social+Business

1.
Hey! It's so nice to see you again. It feels like forever since we last caught up. How have you been?
嗨！再见到你真好。感觉我们很久没聊天了，你最近怎么样？

2.
是啊，好一阵子没见了。这段时间我一直忙着装修家里，现在终于搞定了。总算可以好好享受新家的感觉了！
Yeah, it's been a while! I've been caught up with renovating my home and now it's finally done. I can finally enjoy my new home!

3.
That's awesome! I remember when you showed me your renovation plans. It felt like a huge project. Did everything go as planned?
太棒了！我记得你之前给我看过装修计划，感觉是个大工程。一切顺利吗？

4.
是的，整体来说都挺顺利的。幸运的是，我们找到了一家很靠谱的建筑公司，大工程已经完成了。现在我们正忙着做最后的装饰，让家更有个性。
Yeah, overall, everything went pretty smoothly. Luckily, we found a great contractor, and the big work is done. Now we're just focusing on decorating and adding some personal touches.

5.
Totally! Decorating the entire house must be exhausting, especially with so many decisions to make. It can be overwhelming!
完全同意！给整个房子做装饰肯定是件大工程，特别是要选那么多东西，会很有压力。

6.
我们每次只装饰一个房间，这样不会太赶。反正也不赶时间，这样还能慢慢挑喜欢的东西，不会买了又后悔。
We're taking it one room at a time, so it doesn't feel too overwhelming. There's no rush anyway, and this way, we can carefully pick things we really love instead of making impulsive choices.

7.
That's a great approach! Taking your time means you can really make sure everything turns out just the way you want. What room are you working on at the moment?
这种方式很棒！慢慢来才能装出自己真正喜欢的感觉。你现在在弄哪个房间？

8.
我现在在装饰我女儿的房间。她马上要从婴儿床换成大的平台床了。她成长得实在是太快了！感觉昨天她还在学走路呢！
I'm decorating my daughter's room right now. She's about to move from her crib to a bigger platform bed—it's crazy how fast she's growing! Feels like just yesterday she was learning to walk!

9.
Switching to a platform bed is an important milestone! There are so many great bed options, and some even come with built-in storage.
换平台床可是个重要的里程碑呀。现在很多床都不错，有些还带储物功能。

10.
对啊，这太方便了！儿童房的储物真的很重要，所以我想买一个能用很多年的床，最好是她能一直睡到青少年时期的。
Yeah, that would be so convenient! Storage is a huge deal in a kid's room, so I want to get her a bed that'll last for years, hopefully even into her teenage years.

11.
That's a smart choice. You don't want to redecorate too soon, so getting something that lasts makes a lot of sense.
这个想法很明智，没人想这么快又重新装修，买个耐用的确实更划算。

12.
我们也这么想。所以，我们喜欢简单素净的设计，然后用小地毯这种容易换的小东西来增加一些鲜艳的色彩。
We feel the same way. That's why we go for simple and neutral designs and add some bright colors with easy-to-swap items like rugs.

13.
That sounds perfect! I can't wait to see how your place turns out when everything's done. I bet it's going to look fantastic!
听起来很棒！我特别期待看看你家装好的样子。我觉得肯定会超级好看！

14.
我也很期待让你过来看看！不过估计还得花点时间。慢慢装饰才能让家更有感觉，我不想匆匆忙忙地搞定它。
I'm looking forward to having you over too! But it'll probably take a little more time. Taking it slow makes a home feel more inviting—I don't want to rush it.

#70189. Helping Hands for a Neighbourhood Park - Social

1.
Good afternoon! Come in and take a seat, please. My co-worker mentioned that you were interested in our volunteer program.
下午好！请进，坐吧。我同事说你对我们的志愿者项目感兴趣。

2.
下午好！是的，我刚搬到这个社区一个月，想了解怎么更好地融入这里，多认识一些朋友。
Good afternoon! Yes, I just moved to this neighbourhood a month ago, and I'd love to find ways to get more involved and make new friends.

3.
We're always in need of more volunteers. None of our community projects would be possible without the volunteers who dedicate their time.
我们这边总是需要更多志愿者。如果没有这些热心奉献的志愿者，我们的社区项目根本无法实现。

4.
我在家工作，所以时间比较灵活。每周我能抽出几个小时做志愿者，而且也希望能认识更多人。
I work from home, so my schedule is pretty flexible. I can spare a few hours each week for volunteering, and I'd love to meet more people.

5.
Many of our volunteers end up becoming good friends. Do you have any specific interests? We can try to match you with a project that suits you.
我们很多志愿者最后都成了好朋友。你对什么特别感兴趣吗？我们可以帮你找到一个适合你的项目。

6.
我其实什么都愿意做，但我特别喜欢园艺和种植。我家里正在弄个小菜园。
I'm open to anything, but I really enjoy gardening and planting. I'm actually working on a small vegetable garden at home.

7.
That's perfect! We have a project that would be a great fit for you. We're fixing up the park near the shopping center.
太棒了！我们正好有个非常适合你的项目——修缮购物中心附近的公园。

8.
其实我前几天也注意到了，公园里的灌木丛确实需要修剪，杂草也长得到处都是，整个地方看起来不太美观。
I actually noticed that a few days ago. The bushes definitely need trimming, and the weeds are everywhere. The park doesn't look great right now.

9.
We need people with some gardening experience who can help clean up the space. Everything is overgrown and needs a lot of trimming.
我们需要有园艺经验的人帮忙整理公园。现在那里杂草丛生，需要好好修剪一下。

10.
我会修剪树枝，也懂一点园艺。公园如果整理好了，肯定会变得很漂亮。而且，它还能给社区添上一块舒适的绿色空间。
I have experience trimming branches and know a bit about gardening. Once the park is cleaned up, it'll definitely look beautiful. Plus, it'll give the community a nice green space to enjoy.

11.
There's quite a bit of work to do, but I believe the park will look amazing once it's done. We're also planning to install new benches to make it more inviting.
这项工作量不小，但等公园整理好后，肯定会焕然一新。而且，我们还计划安装新的长椅，让公园更有吸引力。

12.
公园对整个社区来说真的很重要。人们需要一个可以散步的地方，或者只是坐下来放松一下，享受新鲜空气。
Parks are really important for the whole community. People need a space where they can take a walk or just sit down and relax in the fresh air.

13.
Yes, and we're lucky to have raised enough donations to restore it. Everyone is looking forward to the reopening.
是啊，而且我们已经筹集到了足够的捐款来修缮公园，大家都在期待它重新开放。

14.
我很高兴能参与这个项目，帮助改善公园的环境。这不仅能让公园更漂亮，还能让整个社区变得更适合居住。
I'm really happy to be a part of the project and help improve the park. It's not just about making it look nicer—it'll also make the whole neighbourhood a better place to live.

#70188. A Low-score University Assignment - Education

1.
Good afternoon! Come in and take a seat please. I received your email saying you wanted to meet me.
下午好！请进，请坐。我收到了你发的邮件，说你想跟我见面。

2.
您好。是的。谢谢您抽时间见我。
Hello. Yes, thank you for taking the time to see me.

3.
That's totally fine. I try to leave some free time available each day for students. I hope your studies are going well.
没关系。我每天都会尽量给学生留出些空余时间。希望你学习进展顺利。

4.
事实上，我对我第一篇论文的分数不是很满意。我不理解您为什么会给我这么低的分数。
In fact, I'm not very satisfied with the grade I received for my first paper. I don't understand why you gave me such a low score.

5.
Oh, right. I wanted to have a talk with you about that, but I just haven't had the chance.
哦，对。我本来就想和你谈谈这件事，只是一直没机会。

6.
我明白。希望您可以给我一些反馈。距离下一节课还有一小时，希望时间足够。
I understand. I hope you can give me some feedback. There's still an hour until the next class, so I hope we have enough time.

7.
The reason your paper isn't as good as it could be is the structure of your essay. Your ideas are fine, but the paper lacks a clear logical flow.
你论文成绩不理想的原因在于文章的结构。你的观点没问题，但论文缺乏清晰的逻辑性。

8.
哦。我的论文里确实有几个部分是最后几分钟才写的，所以写得比较仓促。我担心涵盖不了题目的所有要求。
Oh. There were indeed a few parts in my paper that I wrote in the final minutes, so they ended up a bit rushed. I was worried that I wouldn't cover all the requirements of the topic.

9.
I see. That might explain why your arguments aren't set up well. It's often not a good idea to keep reworking your paper.
我明白了。这或许能解释为什么你的论点组织得不够好。不断地反复修改论文往往不是个好主意。

10.
我确实有这么做。我发现这篇论文比我想象中要难写，因为需要涵盖很多内容。
I did keep reworking it. I found that this paper was harder to write than I imagined because there was so much to cover.

11.
It is indeed a complicated topic. It's easy to lose direction, especially for university-level assignments.
这个话题确实复杂。很容易迷失方向，尤其是大学程度的作业。

12.
这跟我的中学作业不太一样。我想取得好成绩，但我真的需要帮助。
It's not like my secondary school assignments. I want to get good grades, but I really need some help.

13.
I know a teacher who offers great tutoring sessions on writing papers for first-year students every week. I can give you the details if you're interested.
我认识一位老师，每周都会给大一新生进行论文写作辅导，效果很不错。如果你有兴趣，我可以把详细情况告诉你。

14.
好的，谢谢您。这听起来真是个好主意。我相信这会对我下一次写论文大有帮助。
Okay, thank you. That sounds like a great idea. I believe it will really help me improve my next paper.

#70187. Social Worker Directories - Social

1.
Good morning, it's nice to see you. How have you been recently?
早上好，很高兴见到你。最近怎么样？

2.
你好，我也很高兴能见到你。我最近因为要经常去看望我母亲，她身体不太好。所以我很累。
Hello, I'm also very glad to see you. Recently, I've been frequently visiting my mother because her health hasn't been good. That's why I'm really tired.

3.
I remember you once said that she has not been well recently. You must have spent several hours going back and forth to her house, right?
我记得你曾经说过她最近身体不太好。你肯定花了好几个小时来回跑她家，对吧？

4.
是的，要花很多时间。我每周都要去看她，还得工作，几乎没时间做其他事情。
Yes, it takes a lot of time. I have to visit her every week and also work, so I hardly have time to do anything else.

5.
That sounds very difficult. I heard that you might talk to a social worker. They could help you find services suitable for your mother so that visiting her won't be so tiring.
听起来真不容易。我听说你可以找社工聊聊。他们可能会帮你看看有没有适合你母亲的服务，这样探望她就不会那么辛苦了。

6.
好主意，我之前不知道还能找到这样的帮助。我该去哪儿找社工的联系方式呢？
Good idea, I didn't know I could find such help. Where can I get the contact information of a social worker?

7.
There are social worker associations. You can find their services online and on social media. You can also locate social workers near your mom's home. There are online directories available.
有一些社工协会。你可以在网上和社交媒体上找到他们的服务。你也可以找到离你母亲住处近的社工，还有在线名录可供查找。

8.
谢谢你。有了社工名录的帮助，事情会容易很多。要不然，我真不知道该从哪里开始。
Thank you. With the help of a social worker directory, things would be much easier. Otherwise, I really wouldn't know where to start.

9.
Yes. Since these are professional organizations, you can find their names listed in directories. Elder care is a sensitive matter, so it's important to find someone qualified.
是的。由于这些是专业机构，你可以在名录上查到他们的名字。养老问题很敏感，所以找到有资质的人很重要。

10.
感谢你的信息，真的很有帮助。我有很多问题想问他们。如果有人能帮我照顾我妈直到她好起来，我就放心了。
Thank you for the information; it's really helpful. I have many questions to ask them. If someone could take care of my mother until she gets better, I would feel at ease.

11.
It's always hard when parents get old and need help. It's harder when they don't live nearby.
父母年纪大了需要帮助总是很不容易的，他们不住在附近的话就更不容易了。

12.
我们一直想住得离她近点。在她生病之前，我们就开始看房和准备买房了。但她生病以后，看房计划就搁置了。
We always want to live closer to her. Before she got sick, we were already looking at houses and planning to buy one. But after she fell ill, our house-hunting plans were put on hold.

13.
That's unfortunate. I hope she recovers soon so you can resume your house hunt. There are many houses in this area.
真可惜。我希望她能快点康复，这样你就能继续找房子了。这一带有很多房子。

14.
是的，我希望我们能找到个好房子。这样我去看望母亲就方便多了。
Yes, I hope we can find a good place. That way, it will be much more convenient for me to visit my mother.

#70186. Discussing the Upcoming Museum Visit - Education

1.
Hi! I wanted to meet with you to go over the details of the upcoming class trip. I know there are a lot of things to coordinate, so I thought it'd be good to check in.
你好！我想和你聊聊即将到来的班级旅行的安排。我知道有很多事情要协调，所以想和你确认一下。

2.
您好。真是不好意思，我本来想早点约时间的，但之前一直没能安排上。
Hi! I'm really sorry. I wanted to set up a meeting earlier, but I was never able to make it.

3.
That's totally fine. You were busy. Can you give me more details about the class trip?
没关系，你之前很忙。能跟我详细说说班级旅行的安排吗？

4.
当然可以。班级旅行定在两个星期后。我已经让孩子们把同意书带回家给家长签字了。
Of course! The class trip is in two weeks. I've already asked the students to take the consent forms home for their parents to sign.

5.
Great. I hope the parents can return the consent forms on time, as we can't accept any forms on the day of the trip.
很好。希望家长能按时交回同意书，因为我们不能在旅行当天再接收新的表格。

6.
是的，我已经通知家长了。同意书的截止日期是出发前三天，因为博物馆的工作人员需要提前确认最终人数。
Yes, I've already informed the parents. The deadline for submission is three days before departure, as the museum staff need to confirm the final headcount in advance.

7.
Will the children need to bring their own lunch? I'd also like to know if there's a designated area where they can eat.
孩子们需要自己带午餐吗？另外，那边有专门的用餐区吗？

8.
是的，孩子们可以自己带午餐。博物馆有一个庭院，学生们可以在那里用餐。另外，他们也提供午餐。吃完饭后，孩子们还可以四处走走，等下午的活动开始。
Yes, they can bring their own lunch. The museum has a courtyard where students can eat. They also offer lunch. After lunch, students can walk around before the afternoon session starts.

9.
That sounds like a great setup. This way, they can have a relaxing lunch break and be refreshed for the afternoon activities.
听起来安排得很好。这样他们可以放松地吃午餐，下午的活动也能更好地投入。

10.
希望是这样吧。下午他们还有作业要完成，所以需要集中注意力。
I hope so. They still have assignments to complete in the afternoon, so they'll need to stay focused.

11.
I'm really looking forward to this trip. It will be great to see what the students take away from the experience. Plus, it's always fun to see them engage outside the classroom.
我很期待这次旅行，看看学生们能从中学到什么。而且，能看到他们在课堂外积极参与也会很有趣。

12.
是啊，希望他们既能学到知识，又能玩得开心。他们每次都特别期待班级旅行，总想着能走出教室看看外面的世界。
Yes! Hopefully, they can learn and have fun at the same time. They always look forward to class trips and are eager to explore beyond the classroom.

13.
That's true. You probably need to get back to your class now. Let me know if you have any questions.
确实是这样。你现在可能要回教室了。如果有问题随时告诉我。

14.
谢谢！我差点忘了。组织旅行真的很有挑战。如果有问题，我会尽快找您。
Thank you! I almost forgot. Organizing a trip is really challenging. If I run into any issues, I'll reach out to you as soon as possible.

#70185. Trauma Insurance 101 - Business

1.
Good morning. I didn't expect to hear from you again so soon. I hope everything's alright.
早上好！没想到这么快又收到你的电话，希望一切都顺利。

2.
早上好！谢谢你，一切都挺好的。我知道我们两周前才刚见过面，不过我现在有些保险相关的事情想请你帮忙。
Good morning! Thanks, everything's going well. I know we just met two weeks ago, but I need your help with some insurance matters.

3.
No problem. Are you looking to adjust your current policy or switch to a different type?
没问题！你是想调整现有的保单，还是换一种不同的保险产品？

4.
我最近正在考虑一种新的保险。我一直在网上查询有关创伤保险的信息。我想要进一步了解一下。
I've been looking into a new type of insurance lately. I've been researching trauma insurance online, and I'd like to learn more about it.

5.
Sure! We're more than happy to help with that. I'd be happy to answer all your questions, and I can also give you a quote based on your needs.
当然！我们很乐意帮忙。我可以解答你的所有问题，也可以根据你的需求给你一个报价。

6.
谢谢你！我想知道创伤保险是不是谁都能买？有没有什么限制？
Thanks! I'd like to know—can anyone purchase trauma insurance, or are there any restrictions?

7.
Well, trauma insurance generally excludes pre-existing conditions. So, if you already have any pre-existing conditions covered by your current policy, that particular condition won't be covered under trauma insurance.
嗯，创伤保险一般不保既往病。所以，如果你有什么既往病，现保单也承保，那创伤保险里不会赔付的。

8.
有道理。我现在没有健康问题。但是以后的事情谁知道呢？这个保险能覆盖所有的疾病吗？
That makes sense. I don't have any health issues right now, but who knows what could happen in the future? Does this insurance cover all illnesses?

9.
Trauma insurance coverage is similar to that of other critical illness policies. It usually includes six major categories, such as heart attacks.
创伤保险的保障范围和其他重疾险类似，通常涵盖六大类病症，比如心脏病发作。

10.
你也知道，我现在还有一些债要还。如果以后生病了，可能就没办法继续还款了。所以我觉得这个保险可能是个不错的选择。
You know, I still have some debts to pay off. If I get sick in the future, I might not be able to keep up with the payments. So, I think this insurance could be a good option.

11.
Why don't I give you a few quotes? We can discuss your options and see which one is right for you.
要不我给你一些报价？我们可以讨论讨论你都有哪些选择，看看哪种方案最适合你。

12.
这个计划听起来不错。你可以给我报价的所有信息吗？
That sounds like a good plan. Can you send me all the details of the quotes?

13.
I'll send you a form to fill in. I also need to get some medical information from you to get a quote for this type of insurance.
我会给你发个表格填写。我还需要收集一些你的健康信息才能给这种保险报价。

14.
好的，没问题。我会尽快填好并寄回给你。
Alright, no problem. I'll fill it out as soon as possible and send it back to you.

#70184. Tax Deadlines and Accounting Solutions - Business

1.
Good morning. Thank you for calling. What can I do for you today?
早上好，谢谢你的来电！今天有什么可以帮到你的？

2.
早上好！我有一个自己的生意。我想跟你聊聊，看看你能不能帮我处理一下我生意的会计方面的事情。
Good morning! I run my own business. I'd like to have a chat and see if you can help me with the accounting side of things.

3.
Of course. We're more than happy to help you. We specialize in business accounting. Could you let me know more about your business and the reason you may need an accountant?
当然，我们很乐意帮忙！我们专门做商业会计。你可以告诉我更多关于你的生意和你可能需要会计的原因吗？

4.
我开了一家电脑销售店。我一直都是自己做账的。但是，现在我处理不过来了。我需要会计的帮助。
I run a computer retail store. I've always done the bookkeeping myself, but now it's getting overwhelming. I need an accountant's help.

5.
That actually happens quite often among our clients. Hiring a professional accountant is definitely a great idea. It can help your business grow quickly and avoid more mistakes.
这种情况在我们的客户中很常见。找一个专业会计绝对是个好主意，不仅能让你的生意更快发展，也更能减少出错。

6.
我完全同意你说的。我也不想犯错误啊。但是我越忙，就越容易犯错。
I totally agree. I don't want to make mistakes either. But the busier I get, the easier it is to mess up.

7.
It's actually not hard to prevent that. A professional accountant can ensure your accounts are all in order. Do you have any urgent matters that need to be handled right now?
其实，这并不难避免。专业会计可以帮你把账目整理好。你现在有什么特别紧急的事需要处理吗？

8.
其实，还真的有。对于我来说，目前最紧急的事情就是所得税的申报。还有两天就要截止了。
Actually, yes. Right now, my biggest concern is filing my income tax. The deadline is in two days.

9.
Don't worry. If you have a professional accountant, there will be sufficient time. But you need to send all the relevant documents to our accountant in one go.
别担心，有专业会计的话，时间是够的。但你需要一次性把相关文件发给我们的会计。

10.
听你这么说，我真的松了一口气啊。我正在弄了。之前一年的情况其实都很好，但是最近两个月就特别紧迫。
I'm relieved to hear that. I'm working on it now. The past year was actually fine, but the last two months have been really hectic.

11.
Why don't we schedule a meeting to go through everything? We can also discuss what specific services you need.
我们约个时间详细过一遍吧？也可以讨论一下你具体需要哪些服务。

12.
听上去很完美，谢谢。我想我需要你帮我做所有的事情。我也想更新一下我这边的会计系统。
That sounds perfect, thanks! I think I need you to handle everything for me. I also want to get my accounting system updated.

13.
I'll discuss all the options with you. The right system for business accounting makes everything much simpler and faster.
我会和你讨论所有可选方案。合适的商业会计系统可以让一切更简单、更高效。

14.
太好了！这样的话，我就能把更多时间放在业务上，而不用担心账务问题了。我等你的安排，谢谢！
That's great! This way, I can focus more on my business without stressing over accounting. I'll wait for your arrangements—thank you!

#70183. Packing Up and Selling - Business

1.
Hi, I am so glad you have time to meet up. It has been so long since we last met.
嗨，我真高兴你能抽空见面。自从上次见面已经很久了。

2.
是啊，抱歉我最近太忙了，我准备搬家，有太多事情要做了。
Yeah, sorry, I've been so busy lately. I'm getting ready to move – there's just too much to do.

3.
All right, I didn't know you were moving! I hope you are not moving so far. I will miss seeing you.
好吧，我还不知道你要搬家呢！希望你搬得不远，我会想念见到你的。

4.
不会的，我就搬到隔壁区，我以为我跟你说过了。我的房东把房子卖了，我不得不搬家。
Oh no, I'm only moving to the neighbouring district – I thought I mentioned it. My landlord sold the house, so I have to move.

5.
That sounds stressful. It's hard to rent a place in the area now, and the rent is more expensive.
听着挺紧张的。现在在这附近租房子很难，而且租金也更贵。

6.
是的，我新的房子更小，而且我们要交的租金还更贵。我想要卖掉一些不用的家具物品，来赚点额外的钱。
Yes, my new place is smaller, and the rent is even higher. I want to sell some unused furniture to earn some extra cash.

7.
Why not post some advertisements on social media? There are a few sites that let you do that, and it is very easy.
怎么不在社交媒体上发布广告呢？有几个网站可以发，而且操作很简单。

8.
我也许需要花一些时间来设置这些，但是好在不收钱，这对我们很重要，我们需要尽可能地省钱。
They might take some time to set up, but luckily, they're free – which is important for us since we need to save money wherever possible.

9.
It is definitely time-consuming to sell your things piece by piece, but it will be worth it, because you can make sure you get the right price for your items.
一件一件卖东西肯定很耗时，但这是值得的，因为这样能确保物品都卖到合适的价格。

10.
我也许还能拍一些照片，这样可能可以卖得更快，价格更高，尤其是家具之类的大件东西。
Perhaps I could take some photos; that might help sell them faster and at a higher price, especially for big items like furniture.

11.
It sounds like a good idea. I can help you move your things too; that may save you some moving costs, and I can help pack fragile items.
听起来不错。我也可以帮你搬东西，这样可以节省一些搬家费用，而且我还可以帮忙打包那些易碎物品。

12.
是的，我本来打算自己搬的，这样可以省点钱，能有你帮助可太棒了，谢谢你。
Yeah, I was planning to move by myself to save money, but having your help is just great – thank you.

13.
Of course, I am happy to help you load some boxes and make a few trips. Let me know when you are ready.
当然，我很乐意帮忙装箱并跑几趟。你准备好了就告诉我。

14.
你可真是个好朋友，我们大概两周之内会打包好所有东西，我到时候再给你打电话。
You're such a good friend. We'll probably have everything packed within two weeks, and I'll call you then.

#70182. Promotion and Transition - Business

1.
Hi, thank you for meeting me in the morning. How are you today?
嗨，感谢你今天早上抽时间见我。你今天怎么样？

2.
我很好，谢谢。我也很高兴见到你。我助理说你找我是想跟我谈谈我新工作的事情？
I'm doing well, thank you. I'm also glad to see you. My assistant mentioned that you wanted to talk about my new job?

3.
Yes. Congrats on your promotion! You deserve it. We have been very pleased with your dedication and skills since you joined our company.
是的，恭喜你升职！你当之无愧。自从你加入我们公司以来，我们对你的敬业精神和能力非常满意。

4.
谢谢，我很感激，也很感谢你的支持。我很高兴下周就要开始新的工作了。
Thank you, I really appreciate your support. I'm excited to start my new job next week.

5.
It will be a big change for you, but I'm confident you'll continue to achieve even more, just like before.
这对你来说是个很大的变化，但我相信你会像以前一样，不断取得更多成就。

6.
我会尽力的，现在要管理的事情太多了，接下来几周我会忙于学习。
I will do my best. There are so many management tasks now that I'll be busy learning for the next few weeks.

7.
Yes, I also need your help with hiring some new team members; we received notices of resignation from two people today.
是的，我还需要你帮忙招聘一些新成员；今天我们收到两个人的辞职通知。

8.
我明白了。这不是个好时机啊，我希望他们不是负责新产品的关键项目。
I understand. This isn't an ideal time—I hope the departing employees weren't involved in the key projects for our new product.

9.
No, but we still need someone to replace them so that the team doesn't work under too much stress. I want you to choose candidates for interviews and help us fill the positions promptly.
不，但我们还是得找人接替他们，这样团队就不会压力太大。我希望你能挑选候选人进行面试，并尽快补充空缺。

10.
没问题，我很乐意帮忙，但是我不确定我有没有时间，因为我还在处理当前的工作。
No problem, I'm happy to help, but I'm not sure if I'll have enough time because I'm still handling my current workload.

11.
I think it would be best for you to hand over your current responsibilities to your replacement early, so that you can focus on your new job.
我觉得你最好提前把现在的工作交接给你的接替者，这样你就能专心于新工作了。

12.
好啊，听上去是个不错的计划。我已经准备好了交接的文件，所以我明天就可以开始。
That sounds like a great plan. I've already prepared the handover documents, so I can start tomorrow.

13.
Perfect! I'm glad that you are prepared; that's very efficient. It will make our work a lot easier in the coming weeks.
完美！我很高兴你已经准备好了，这真高效。这将使我们接下来的工作轻松许多。

14.
我认为到时候会很忙，但是我很期待这种挑战。
I think it will be very busy then, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.

#70181. From Clinic to Home - Medical

1.
Good afternoon, it's good to see you again. How can I help you today?
下午好，很高兴再次见到您。今天有什么可以帮您的？

2.
下午好，我很好，谢谢。我想为我父亲来预约个时间。
Good afternoon, I'm doing well, thank you. I'd like to schedule an appointment for my father.

3.
Of course. Please take a seat and make yourself comfortable. The doctor will be with you shortly. He is on time for appointments today.
当然，请坐，放轻松。医生很快就会过来，今天他出诊非常准时。

4.
太好了。在我们等待的时候，如果你有几分钟空闲时间，我能请教你一些问题吗？
That's great. While we wait, if you have a few minutes free, may I ask you some questions?

5.
Sure, no problem. It's quiet at the moment, so I'm free. I just need to pick up the phone if it rings.
当然，没问题。现在这里很安静，所以我有时间。只不过要是电话响了，我得去接。

6.
我父亲上个月割伤了腿，感染了，伤口需要换药。这就是我们定期来诊所的原因。
My father cut his leg last month, and it got infected; his wound needs regular dressing changes. That's why we come to the clinic regularly.

7.
I understand. Proper wound dressing is very important to control infection and help the cut heal properly, although it's often uncomfortable.
我明白。妥善换药对于控制感染和促使伤口正确愈合非常重要，虽然这通常不太舒服。

8.
不是的，他觉得非常疼。每次来诊所对他来说都很折腾。我想知道有没有居家护理护士可以帮忙。
No, he finds it very painful. Every visit to the clinic is exhausting for him. I wonder if there's a home care nurse available to help.

9.
A home care nurse can handle a range of medical needs. It might be a much easier option in your father's situation.
居家护理护士可以处理各种医疗需求。对于您父亲的情况来说，这个选择可能轻松得多。

10.
我也觉得。我们两个都觉得现在的情况很麻烦，但是我们不清楚怎么安排，也不清楚跟谁联系。
I think so too. We both find the current situation very troublesome, but we're not sure how to arrange it or whom to contact.

11.
You can ask the doctor about it. He can refer you to a service provider and give you information about the process.
您可以问问医生。他可以转介您到相关服务机构，并提供办理流程的信息。

12.
哦，太好了。我等会儿就问医生。我本以为这或许比转诊更复杂。感谢您的信息！
Oh, that's great. I'll ask the doctor shortly. I originally thought this might be more complicated than a referral. Thanks for the information!

13.
I'm happy to help. I think you will find that this arrangement works very well. But I will miss seeing you and your father at the clinic.
我很乐意帮忙。我相信您会发现这个安排非常合适。但我会想念在诊所见到您和您父亲的日子。

14.
我们还会定期来做检查，我们信任这里的医生。您和其他工作人员都非常友善，谢谢！
We will still come in for regular check-ups because we trust the doctors here. You and the other staff are all very kind—thank you!

#70180. Downsizing After 15 Years - Business

1.
Good afternoon, thank you for calling. Please let me know what help you need today.
下午好，感谢您的来电。请告诉我今天需要什么帮助。

2.
下午好，我看到你们卖房子的广告，我想要了解这个。
Good afternoon, I saw your advertisement about selling houses and would like to know more about it.

3.
Of course. Buying and selling properties is my main business, although we do manage rental apartments in town.
当然。买卖房产是我的主要业务，虽然我们也管理市区的出租公寓。

4.
我有一个七个卧室的房子，离市区不远，我已经在那里住了15年了，我想把它卖掉。
I have a seven-bedroom house not far from the city center. I have lived there for 15 years and now want to sell it.

5.
It must be a big change after 15 years. Fortunately, it's a very good time to sell at the moment, so you picked an opportune time.
过了15年，一定变化很大。好在现在卖房是个不错的时机，所以您选择的时机非常合适。

6.
我的孩子们都搬出去了，所以我想要换一个小房子。但是我不太清楚卖房子的方式都有哪些。
My children have all moved out, so I want to downsize. However, I'm not very clear about the various methods of selling a house.

7.
It's okay. It's something that all homeowners need to consider before they sell their properties. There are several different options you can consider.
没关系。卖房前每个房主都需要考虑这个问题。有几种不同的方式，您都可以考虑。

8.
那时我是从我朋友那里买的房子，我对于不同的卖房方式以及各自的优点都不了解。
I bought the house from a friend, so I'm not familiar with the different selling methods and their advantages.

9.
The size of the house is typical for this area. Private treaty sales can be effective for achieving a realistic price.
在这个区域，这种房子的面积是常见的。采用私人协议方式销售可以更容易达到一个合理的价格。

10.
我觉得有一个特定的价格是好的。这样的话，我就大概能知道期待的价格是多少了。
I think having a fixed price is good. That way, I can have an idea of what to expect.

11.
Yes. It helps the buyer as well—you have more time to consider all the offers. Unlike auctions, you don't need to set a specific date to sell the property.
是的，这样也有助于买家，让您有更多时间考虑所有的报价。与拍卖不同，您不需要为出售房产设定一个特定的日期。

12.
听你这样说很好。就像其他卖家一样，我想尽量卖个好价钱。你觉得卖这个房子推荐哪种方式呢？
That sounds good. Like other sellers, I want to get the best price possible. Which selling method do you recommend for this house?

13.
I need to visit your house first. If you are at home Wednesday afternoon, I can come then. You just need to text me your address.
我需要先去您家看看。若您周三下午在家，我可以那时过来。您发短信告诉我地址就好。

14.
好的，谢谢。这对我来说很合适。期待周三下午见您。祝您有个愉快的一天。
Alright, thank you. That works well for me. I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday afternoon. Have a great day!

#70179. Stolen Tools Report - Legal

1.
Hello, this is the police assistance hotline. How can I help you?
你好，这里是警方协助热线。我能帮您什么忙？

2.
你好，我不知道我是否打对了电话号码。我想报案。
Hello, I'm not sure if I dialled the right number. I'd like to report a crime.

3.
OK. You called the right number. There is a different number if you need to report something very serious.
好的，您打对了。如果您要报非常严重的案件，会有另一个号码。

4.
好的，不是特别严重的事，但对我来说很重要，没有人有危险，不是很严重。
Alright, it's not extremely serious, but it's important to me. No one is in immediate danger.

5.
That's good. I understand all sorts of crime can affect the victim. Let's take the crime report.
那就好。我知道各种犯罪都会影响受害者。我们来记录案情吧。

6.
谢谢，保险公司让我报警, 才能申请理赔。
Thank you. My insurance company told me to report the crime before filing a claim.

7.
Understood. Please describe the incident in detail.
明白。请详细描述事发经过。

8.
我是建筑工人，在工地上班。我停在工地的车被撬了，工具全被偷了。我简直不敢相信。
I'm a construction worker, working on a site. My car parked at the site was broken into, and all my tools were stolen. I just can't believe it.

9.
Sorry to hear that. Tools, especially power tools, are always common targets for thieves since they can sell them online or to shops.
听到这个消息我感到非常抱歉。工具，尤其是电动工具，总是小偷盯上的常见目标，因为他们可以把工具在网上卖掉，或者卖给商店。

10.
如果小偷把他们卖到商店，警察可能会找到，和其他人一样，我在上面刻了信息。这样能帮助追查吗？
If the thief sells them to shops, the police might trace them. Like many others, I had my details engraved on them. Will that help tracking/ Will that help with the investigation?

11.
Excellent precaution! This significantly improves recovery chances. We'll do our best to investigate the incident and recover your property if possible.
这个预防措施很好。能大大提高找回几率。我们会尽力调查此事，并在可能的情况下追回您的财物。

12.
我买了保险是很好的。即使没有找到，也可以向保险公司申请理赔。我的保险涵盖盗窃损失，但需要案件编号，才能启动理赔。
It's great that I have insurance; even if nothing is recovered, I can still file a claim with my insurer. My insurance covers theft losses, but I need a case number to initiate the claim.

13.
Yes. We still need more details about the crime. Please provide any additional information you can remember. Then I'll fill out the official report and email it to you for your claim.
是的，我们还需要更多关于案件的细节。请把你能记得的其他信息提供给我，然后我会把正式报案记录填写好，并通过邮件发给你，好让你申请理赔。

14.
好的，谢谢您的帮助。我再仔细回想一下，如果我能想起来任何别的细节，我再跟您联系。
Alright, thank you for your help. I'll think it over carefully, and if I recall any additional details, I'll get back to you.

#70178. Settling In and Planting Seeds - Social

1.
Hi, long time no see! How's everything going?
好久不见！最近一切都好吗？

2.
你好啊！搬到一个新国家，对一个家庭来说，确实是个很大的挑战。不过，我们真的很喜欢这里。
Hi! Moving to a new country is indeed a big challenge for a family, but we really love it here.

3.
That's good. I am glad to hear that. It's brave of you to move to a new country when you are not familiar with it.
太好了，我很高兴听你这么说。你在对这里还不熟悉的情况下，就搬来一个新的国家，真的很勇敢。

4.
即使我不熟悉这里，我们很兴奋，我想，等我们找到新朋友，孩子们也去上学了，我们就会觉得这边的生活舒适自由。
Even though I'm not familiar with this place, we're very excited. I think once we make new friends and the kids start school, we'll feel that life here is comfortable and free.

5.
I'm sure you will. I don't mind being your first friend. Let me know if you need help meeting people.
一定会的。我愿意成为你的第一个朋友。如果需要我帮忙认识新朋友，尽管开口。

6.
谢谢你！这很暖心。事实上，我想问下这附近有花园用品商店吗？
Thank you. That's so sweet. Actually, I'd like to ask if there are any garden supplies stores around here?

7.
It depends on what type of garden supplies you need. There are two gardening centres.
这要看你需要什么样的园艺用品。这里有两家园艺中心。

8.
我在自己国家有一个花园，我想买点种子，你觉得哪种种子好？
Back in my home country I had a garden, and now I want to buy some seeds. Which kind do you think is good?

9.
It depends on the weather. Some seeds grow very well. You can ask one of our neighbours.
这要看天气，有些种子长得特别好。你可以问问我们的邻居。

10.
啊，那好的。我还没见过他呢。如果我想跟他聊聊园艺的事儿，去敲他的门，会不会冒昧啊？他会介意吗？
Ah, alright. I haven't met him yet. If I want to talk with him about gardening and knock on his door, would that be too forward? Do you think he'd mind?

11.
No, not at all. I can introduce you to him if you like. He has a good garden, and he knows where to buy seeds.
不会的，完全不会。如果你愿意，我可以把他介绍给你。他的花园打理得很好，也很清楚哪里可以买到种子。

12.
太好了！我很好奇在不同国家，不同气候，能种些什么种子。
Great! I'm really curious about what kinds of seeds can be grown in different countries and climates.

13.
Let me know if you start. I can help you if you like. Keep me posted! I've got spare tools you can borrow.
如果你开始动手，告诉我一声。如果你需要，我可以帮忙。随时告诉我进展！我有多余的工具可以借给你。

14.
谢谢，我很感激你的帮忙，我很高兴能在这里种菜。能继续园艺的爱好，也让我对新生活充满了期待。
Thank you, I really appreciate your help. I'm so happy to be able to grow vegetables here. Continuing my passion for gardening makes me look forward to my new life.

#70177. Booking a 100th Birthday Shoot - Business

1.
Good morning! Thanks for calling Photography Moments. This is Penny speaking
早上好！感谢致电"摄影时刻"，我是佩妮。

2.
你好，佩妮，我想预约拍一些照片。有人向我推荐了你，说你是很棒的家庭摄影师。
Hi Penny, I'd like to book a photoshoot. Someone recommended you to me and said you're an amazing family photographer.

3.
That's lovely to hear! Many of my clients come back to capture different moments in their lives.
真高兴听到这个！我的很多客户都会回来，记录他们人生中的不同时刻。

4.
我觉得和一个摄影师长期合作是很好的。我认为和别人一起工作一段时间也是很好的。照片很重要，没有照片的话，很难记住很多人生重要时刻。
I think it's great to work with a photographer long-term. I believe working with someone over time is really beneficial. Photos are so important—without them, it's hard to remember many of life's important moments.

5.
That's so true! I enjoy giving reminders of capturing special occasions and meaningful moments. It's also fun to meet different people.
太对了！我喜欢帮大家记录捕捉那些特别的日子和有意义的时刻。而且，认识新的人也很有趣。

6.
我的好祖母快100岁了，我想给她拍一些照片，庆祝她的生日。
My dear grandmother is almost 100 years old, and I'd like to have her photographed to celebrate her birthday.

7.
Wow! What a fabulous milestone! That's a wonderful way to celebrate her birthday. Would you like to include other family members in the photos?
哇！这可是一个了不起的里程碑/大事啊！用这种方式庆祝她的生日可太棒了。你想让其他家人一起入镜吗？

8.
是的，她特别希望和孙辈们一起合影，对她来说，这很重要。但孙辈们还太小，可能以后记不住她了。
Yes, she really wants to have photos taken with her grandchildren. It means a lot to her. But her grandchildren are still so young that they might not remember her in the future.

9.
Of course. It's such a good idea. Sounds like you'd prefer a cozy, candid family shoot rather than formal portraits, is that right?
当然啦。这主意真好。听起来你更想要温馨自然的家庭照，而不是正式的人像照，对吧？

10.
是的，我想在家里拍一些可爱的随意的照片。我不想要正式的摆拍的照片，那样每个人看上去都不自在。
Yes, I'd like to take some lovely, casual photos at home. I don't want formal, posed pictures because they make everyone look uncomfortable.

11.
Absolutely! Formal photos are not necessarily unnatural, but I do find people nowadays prefer a natural, relaxed look in their photos.
完全理解！正式照也不一定会不自然，不过我确实发现，现在的人更喜欢自然随性的照片。

12.
请问你有摄影的价格表吗？这样我可以看看不同的拍摄方案，决定选择拍哪种类型。
Do you have a photography price list? That way I can look at the different session options and decide which type to book.

13.
Yes! I'll send it to you. We actually have some special deal sessions at the moment, so I'll include those too.
当然！我会把价格表发给你。我们现在正好有一些优惠拍摄套餐，我也一并发你。

14.
谢谢你的帮助。我先看看价格表，等我准备好预定了，再给你打电话。
Thanks for your help! I'll take a look at the price list, and I'll call you when I'm ready to book.

#70176. Birthday Party Venue Planning - Social

1.
Hi, it's good to see you. I've bought some coffee and cakes for us.
嗨，见到你真开心。我给我们买了咖啡和蛋糕。

2.
太好了，谢谢你。我也很高兴见到你。我们有段时间没见了。
That's great, thank you! I'm happy to see you too. It's been a while since we last met.

3.
It's been way too long! It's ridiculous that we only live three streets apart! But life gets so busy. And your big birthday is coming up!
真是太久没见了！我们才相隔三条街，(居然还没见面)，真是不可思议！但是生活变得太忙了。另外，快到你的重要生日了！

4.
哦，天啊，是的。我还有很多事情要做。我还没有定场地，邀请函也还没有发出去。
Oh gosh, yes! I still have so much to do. I haven't booked a venue yet, and I haven't even sent out the invitations.

5.
I thought you were going to have it at your place? I remember we talked about it last time anyway.
我记得你说过要在家里办，不是吗？总之我记得上次我们聊过这个。

6.
原本我是这样计划的。但是客人名单一直在增加，现在还有很多家人要从海外过来。
That was the original plan. But the guest list just keeps growing, and now a lot of my family members are coming from overseas.

7.
How about the community hall? It's really nice, and I don't think it's expensive to hire. A friend of mine had her wedding there.
要不考虑一下社区大厅？那里环境挺不错的，我觉得租金应该也不贵。我有个朋友就在那儿办的婚礼。

8.
我已经有一段时间没去社区大厅了。但是我上次去的时候，我觉得那儿的厨房不太好。
I haven't been there for a while. But the last time I went there, I didn't think the kitchen was very good.

9.
Oh, it's been updated recently. It's now a commercial-grade kitchen. I think they offer a suitable catering service.
哦，那里最近升级了，现在是商业级厨房了。我觉得他们提供的餐饮服务很合适。

10.
哦，那样的话，那里可能确实是个完美的场地。因为有太多客人要来了，我肯定需要安排餐饮服务。
Oh, then that might actually be a perfect venue. Because with so many guests coming, I definitely need catering.

11.
If you need a place for your guests to stay, I have two spare rooms. I'd be happy to host your family.
如果你需要给客人安排住的地方，我家有两个空房间，欢迎你家人住我这儿。

12.
哦，谢谢你，那太好了。但是我还不确定他们想要住在哪儿。如果我确实需要额外的床位，我会给你打电话的。
Oh, thank you! That's really kind. But I'm not sure where they'd like to stay yet. If I do need extra beds, I'll give you a call.

13.
Sure! I'm really looking forward to your birthday party. Do let me know if you need help—especially on the day.
当然！我真的很期待你的生日派对。有需要帮忙的话，一定告诉我，特别是当天。

14.
我想我可能会采纳你的建议。我先把场地订好，确认好宾客名单。如果我需要帮忙，我就给你打电话。
I think I may take your advice. First, I'll book the venue and finalise the guest list. If I need help, I'll call you.

#70175. Drainage Concerns - Business

1.
Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Streamline Drainage Services. This is Marion, one of the drainage specialists here. How can I help you today?
下午好，感谢致电顺流排水服务。我是马里恩，这边的一位排水专家。今天我能帮您些什么？

2.
下午好，我家的排水有问题，我朋友推荐我给您打电话求助。
Good afternoon. I'm having some drainage issues at my place, and a friend recommended that I call you for help.

3.
Well, we always appreciate referrals from happy customers! Could you tell me more about the drainage problem you're experiencing?
嗯，我们一直都很感激满意客户的推荐。您能再说说遇到了什么排水问题吗？

4.
我住在这个房子里两年了，之前一直都没问题。但是最近遇到了积水问题，而且情况越来越糟了。
I've been living in this house for two years, and it had always been fine. But recently, I've been having a water pooling problem, and it's getting worse.

5.
That doesn't sound good. There are a lot of possible causes. Can you give me more details?
听起来不太妙。有可能导致积水的原因有很多，能跟我具体描述一下吗？

6.
我家后花园的地势是向房子这边倾斜的。下大雨的时候，雨水会顺着坡流下来，积攒在房屋周围。
My back garden slopes toward the house. When it rains heavily, the water runs down the slope and pools around the house.

7.
I see. If the flooding only started recently, there must have been some changes around your property.
明白了。如果积水是最近才出现的，那周围环境一定发生了什么变化。

8.
既然您提到了这一点，我家后面同一地块的邻居最近几周一直在装修。
Now that you mention it, the neighbor on the same lot behind my house has been renovating for the past few weeks.

9.
That's interesting. It could definitely be related, especially if they've added something like a deck or made changes to the landscape of the yard.
有意思。这很可能有关系，尤其是如果他们加盖了像是露台这样的东西，或者改动了院子的地形。

10.
听起来您很了解这方面的问题，我能请您过来帮我看看出了什么问题吗？
You sound like you really know your stuff. Would you be able to come over and take a look?

11.
Of course. We need to identify the exact problem before figuring out the best solution. Hopefully, it'll be an easy fix.
当然。我们得先找出问题的根源，才能决定最好的解决方案。希望这个问题好处理。

12.
我也是这样希望的。如果您明天有空，我明天一整天都在家。您随时过来都可以。
I hope so too. If you're available tomorrow, I'll be home all day, so you can come anytime.

13.
Unfortunately, I'm not available tomorrow, but I can come the day after if that works for you.
很抱歉，明天我不行，但后天可以，不知道您方便吗？

14.
好的，后天可以的。谢谢您这么快就能过来排查问题。我真希望在此期间不会再下雨了。
Alright, the day after tomorrow works for me. Thanks for coming over so quickly to check things out. I really hope it doesn't rain again before then.

Hi, I've been a long-time customer of yours. I'd like to learn about taking out additional insurance.

当然！我们非常感谢我们的老顾客。您可以告诉我您的需求吗？这样我可以为您提供最合适的帮助。

4.
我正在考虑买船，但是我觉得在买之前，我应该了解一下为船投保需要花多少钱。
I'm thinking about buying a boat, but before I do, I'd like to get an idea of how much boat insurance would cost.

5.
That sounds exciting! It's definitely a smart move to check insurance costs before making such a big purchase.
听起来很棒！在这样一笔大开销之前，先了解保险费用绝对是个聪明的决定。

6.
是的，我还想给我的车买一个拖车，我想确保我能承担得起所有的开销。
Yes, I'm also planning to get a trailer for my car. I just want to make sure I can afford all the expenses.

7.
That makes sense! It's important to have everything properly insured in case of an accident. What type of boat are you considering?
很有道理！确保所有东西都投保好，以防发生意外是很重要的。您打算买哪种船呢？

8.
我正考虑买一个带船舱的游艇。我的孩子们都很喜欢水上运动，一直要我买船。
I'm thinking about getting a yacht with a cabin. My kids love water sports and have been asking me to get a boat.

9.
That sounds like a fantastic way to enjoy quality time with your family. Motoring on water is really popular, and a yacht would be great for that!
这听起来是个和家人共享美好时光的很棒的方式。水上驾驶很受欢迎，游艇确实是个不错的选择！

10.
是的，我想和孩子们一起出去野餐，享受在夏天游泳的乐趣。
Yes! I'd love to take them out for picnics and enjoy swimming in summer.

11.
We offer a range of insurance policies for different types and sizes of boats. Plus, we have discounts for customers who already have policies with us.
我们提供针对不同类型和尺寸船只的各种保险保单。此外，对于已经在我们公司投保的客户，还有折扣优惠。

12.
是的，我也有买你们的其他保险。我的汽车和房屋保险都是在你们公司买的，所以我才给你打电话问报价。
Yes, I also have other policies with you. My car and home insurance are both with your company. This is why I called you to ask for a quote.

13.
That's great! If you can provide me with more details about your boat, I can connect you with an agent to get a quote.
太好了！如果您能提供更多关于船的详细信息，我可以帮您联系代理，看看报价。

14.
是的，我准备了详细的信息，而且我现在有时间。太好了，非常感谢你。
Yes, I've got all the details ready, and I have time now. That's perfect—thank you so much!

#70173. Water Restrictions in Australia - Social+Legal

1.
Good morning, thank you for your call. How can I help you today?
早上好，感谢您的来电。我能帮您什么忙吗？

2.
我刚搬到这里，我有些关于用水限制的问题。
I just moved here, and I have some questions about water restrictions.

3.
I'd be happy to help. Right now, we're at Level Two water restrictions.
我很乐意帮忙。目前我们处于二级水限制。

4.
我刚来到澳大利亚，不熟悉用水限制。我邻居说这跟降雨量不足有关。
I just came to Australia, and I'm not familiar with the water restrictions. My neighbor said it has something to do with low rainfall.

5.
Yes, that's right. Because of low rainfall, we need to conserve water. That means there are certain rules about how and when you can use it at home.
没错，因为降雨量不足，我们需要节约用水。这意味着家里用水会有一些规则，关于怎么用水和什么时候用水。

6.
我明白了。那很有道理。在我的国家，我们有季风，干旱，洪水。这些甚至比降水量少更严重，我知道在澳大利亚的情况不一样。
I see. That makes a lot of sense. In my country, we have monsoons, droughts, and floods. Those are even worse than low rainfall. I know the situation is different in Australia.

7.
Exactly. When we don't get enough rain, the water levels in the reservoirs behind dams drop, which affects our drinking water supply. This is a problem.
没错。如果降雨不足，大坝后的水库水位就会下降，这会影响我们的饮用水供应。这是个问题。

8.
但是，在天气很热很干的时候，我的草坪和花园都会被影响到。我可以给它们浇水吗？
But when it's really hot and dry, my lawn and garden get affected. Am I allowed to water them?

9.
Yes, you can, but only with a watering can. And you should do it before 10AM or after 4 PM—just not in the middle of the day.
是的，您可以，但只能用浇水壶。而且您应该在早上10点之前或下午4点之后浇水，不要在中午时分。

10.
好的，我会照你说的做的。我会去园艺中心买个喷壶。我想我们只能希望早点下雨。
Got it! I'll follow the rules. I'll go to a gardening center to buy a watering can. I guess we can only hope for some rain soon.

11.
If you need more information about water restrictions, you can check the council's website. There's a page with all the details.
如果您需要更多关于用水限制的信息，可以查阅市政网站。网站上有一页详细介绍所有内容。

12.
听起来很不错。我会去网站上看看的。我不想因为不熟悉规定而做错事情。
That sounds great. I'll check out the website. I don't want to make any mistakes because I'm not familiar with the rules.

13.
Restrictions will change as well. You can sign up for notifications on the website, so you'll always be updated. This would help you.
限制也会发生变化。您可以在网站上注册接收通知，这样您就能随时获得更新。这会帮助您。

14.
这是个好主意。谢谢你今天的帮助。我现在就去网站上看看。
That's a good idea. Thanks for your help today. I'll go check out the website now.

#70172. Looking for a Foster Pet - Social

1.
Good morning! Welcome to the animal shelter. Let me know how I can help you today.
早上好！欢迎来到动物收容所。我今天能怎么帮助你呢？

2.
你好，我经常从这里路过。我看到你们门上贴了关于小猫和小狗的领养海报。
Hi! I walk past here quite often. I saw some adoption posters for kittens and puppies on your door.

3.
I can introduce you to our adoption options, whether you're interested in a dog, a cat, or even a bird. We also have some rabbits at the moment.
我可以给你介绍我们的领养选项，你可以选择狗、猫，甚至是鸟。我们现在还有一些兔子哦。

4.
我现在还不能正式领养宠物，但是我可以暂时照看动物。
I can't officially adopt a pet right now, but I can foster animals temporarily.

5.
That's also great! Temporary fostering helps us a lot. It's also beneficial to the animals, but we expect you to commit to it for at least one month.
那也太棒了！临时寄养对我们帮助很大，对动物们也很有好处。但我们希望你至少能照顾一个月。

6.
我很乐意照顾动物一个月。但是我不知道猫还是狗更适合我。
I'd love to foster for a month. But I'm not sure whether a cat or a dog would be a better fit for me.

7.
Dogs and cats have different needs. It depends on your living situation and personal preference.
猫狗的需求不太一样，这主要取决于你的生活环境和个人喜好。

8.
我和我的老父亲住在一起，我们都喜欢狗。不过，我的父亲拄着拐杖，我们不能照顾太活泼的狗。
I live with my elderly father, and we both love dogs. But my father uses a cane, so we can't handle a dog that's too energetic.

9.
Even though some well-behaved big dogs are great companions, they may not be ideal for the elderly or those with mobility issues. A small dog might be a better choice.
尽管一些性格温顺的大狗很适合作伴，但它们可能不太适合老人或者行动不便的人。一只小狗可能会更合适。

10.
小狗更容易遛。我在你们的海报上看到了一只毛茸茸的小狗。
Small dogs are easier to walk. I saw a fluffy little dog on your poster.

11.
Yes, I know which dog you're talking about. It's well-behaved and would be a good fit for you and your father.
对，我知道你说的是哪只狗。它很乖，应该很适合你和你父亲。

12.
太棒了！我想领养它。我需要办理什么手续？虽然我不太了解具体流程，但我很开心能做这件事。
This is amazing! I want to adopt it. What paperwork do I need to complete? I'm not too familiar with the process, but I'm really happy to do this.

1.
Good morning, welcome. I believe you're here for some information about voting in Australia.
早上好，欢迎。我想您是来了解澳大利亚的投票信息的吧。

2.
可不是嘛。我知道全国大选没多久了，我想知道我能不能投票。
Exactly. I know the national election is coming up soon, and I'd like to know if I'm eligible to vote.

3.
You can enroll to vote if you're a citizen and over 18 years old.
如果您是公民，并且年满18岁，就可以登记投票。

4.
我当然不止18岁了，我去年6月份成为了澳大利亚公民，我还有护照。
I'm definitely over 18! I became an Australian citizen last June, and I have my passport.

Great. You must also have lived at your current address for more than one month in order to vote.

6.
当然，我在这里住了3年了。我还不太明白怎么注册，你能解释一下吗？

Before you can vote, you have to include your name on the roll. You can enroll online using your passport as proof of identity.
在投票之前，您需要把名字加入选民名单。您可以通过护照在网上登记，作为身份证明。

8.
听起来这是最容易的办法。我还想了解其他注册方法，有时候因为我住的地方的网络问题，我没办法上网。
That sounds like the easiest way. I'd like to know about other methods to enrol. Sometimes, the internet where I live has issues, so I can't get online.

9.
You can print the enrollment form from the election website, and then mail or email it to the election office. Or you can visit the election office and enrol in person.
您可以从选举网站打印注册表，然后邮寄或电邮给选举办公室。您也可以亲自到选举办公室注册。

10.
谢谢，现在我有更多选择了。我会尽早注册，我不想错过投票，离大选已经没几个月了。
Thank you, I have more options now. I'll enrol as soon as possible. I don't want to miss voting, and the election is only a few months away.

11.
By law, Australian citizens must vote, or you'll be fined if you don't. You're doing the right thing by enrolling early.
根据法律，澳大利亚公民必须投票，否则会被罚款。您现在注册是个正确的选择。

12.
我之前不知道，投票让我很兴奋。我会去查看网站并且注册，谢谢你的帮助，和你交谈很高兴。
I didn't know that before. I'm excited to vote! I'll check the website and enroll. Thanks for your help; it's been nice talking with you.

Good afternoon. This is the language learning school. My name is Jack.
下午好。这是语言学习学校。我叫杰克。

2.
下午好。我想咨询一下给女儿安排语言课程。
Good afternoon. I'd like to ask about arranging language lessons for my daughter.

她已经16岁了，她决定在两年后，去国外旅行一段时间。
She's 16 now, and she's decided to travel overseas for a while in two years.

That sounds exciting! It's great for her to have an adventure planned and something to look forward to after finishing school.
听起来真让人兴奋！有冒险计划，完成学业后也有所期待，真棒。

6.
是的，这对她非常好。学习语言可以帮她为出国做好准备，旅游也会更轻松，还可以让她更好地和当地人交流。
Yes, it's really good for her. Learning a language will help her get ready for going overseas, make traveling easier, and allow her to communicate better with the locals.

7.
That's an excellent idea. We have several young students here. They are also learning a new language to travel overseas after school.
这是个很好的主意。我们这里有好几个年轻学生，他们也在学一门新语言，以便毕业后能去海外旅行。

8.
很高兴听到其他同学也是这样的。她准备去欧洲旅游。大部分的时间，她会在西班牙。
I'm glad to hear that other students are doing the same. She plans to travel around Europe, and she'll spend most of her time in Spain.

好的。我们确实提供西班牙语课程。下一期的初级班是下个月底开。这个时机应该很合适。

这个…我不确定这个是不是合适。她希望下周左右就能开始上课。

We may be able to arrange some lessons that suit her in the meantime. Why don't we meet up and discuss the options?
在这期间，我们也许可以安排一些适合她的课程。我们见面聊聊看都有哪些选择，您看怎么样？

12.
那太好了，但我们要上学和工作，很难在白天的时候见面。
That sounds great, but with school and work, it's hard for us to meet during the day.

13.
That won't be a problem. Most of the classes are in the evenings or on weekends. I'm sure we can find a suitable time.
这不是问题。大部分课程都是在晚上或周末。我相信我们能找到合适的时间。

14.
谢谢你，我会和女儿商量好时间，再打电话来预约的。
Thank you! I'll discuss a time with my daughter and call back to make an appointment.

#70167. Discussing an engagement Party - Social+Business

Hi. How are you? I just received an invitation to your daughter's engagement party.
你好，最近怎么样？我刚收到你女儿订婚派对的请帖。

2.
哦, 那太好了! 我还在想着，你什么时候才能收到请帖呢。

是啊，最近邮递服务慢了点，但比起邮件，收到正式的请帖还是更好。

我希望，大家都能来她的订婚仪式。我们的请帖发得比较早，因为，我们需要一些时间去准备。我真的希望，你能来参加。
I really hope everyone can come to her engagement party. We sent the invitations out early because we need some time to prepare. I really hope you can make it.

我明白，这是个重要的场合，有很多要安排的。我应该能去，我会把日期记在日历上。

6.

That would make me so happy! I hope we can find a good place to bring everyone together. My daughter and I haven't decided on the venue yet.

7.
Oh dear. It can be hard to find a good place. If she wants to have a formal one, I know somewhere good. It's a new restaurant that overlooks a lovely beach.
哎呀，找个好地方确实不容易。如果她想办个正式的，我知道一个不错的地方。是一家新开的餐厅，能看到美丽的海滩景色。

8.
她确实想要一个正式的仪式。她希望每个人都盛装出席，或者，至少穿得正式一点。她想办一个酒会，而不是坐下吃饭的晚宴。
She does want a formal ceremony. She hopes everyone will dress up, or at least wear something a bit formal. She's thinking of having a cocktail party, not a sit-down banquet.

9.
That restaurant is perfect for her then. There is a beautiful beach view with a deck outside and fancy décor inside.
那家餐厅就很适合她呀，外面有个露台可以看到海滩，里面的装饰也很高级。

10.
听起来很好呀。她现在还在考虑呢，因为有太多选择了，真不好决定呀。
Sounds great! She's still thinking about it—there are so many options, it's hard to make a decision.

11.
I'm happy to help you plan if you need. I am retired now, and I used to work as an event planner for a few years.
如果你需要，我很愿意帮忙。我现在退休了，以前做了好几年活动策划。

12.
我还真不知道你以前做过活动策划呀！我们确实需要帮忙。我和我女儿已经忙不过来了，都压得喘不过来气了。你能抽时间帮我们，真的是太慷慨了！我太感激了！
I didn't know you used to work as an event planner! We really need help. My daughter and I are swamped, we're barely keeping up. It's so generous of you to offer your time. I'm really grateful.

13.
I'm happy to help if you would like. I can meet you and your daughter in a few days to talk more.
如果你愿意的话, 我很乐意帮忙的。我们可以过几天再见面，跟你和你女儿详细聊聊。

14.
太好了！有你的帮忙真是太好了！很开心能在这里遇见你！

6.
我觉得这次活动可以跟动物有关。你觉得跟本地的动物收容所合作怎么样？
I think this event could be animal-related. What do you think about cooperating with the local animal shelter?

7.
What do you think about organizing a native animal show? We can advertise locally, and I think it would be a hit with families. It would offer something fresh and different.
你觉得组织一个本地动物展怎么样？我们可以在本地宣传，我觉得家庭会很喜欢。这可以带来一些新鲜和不同的体验。

8.
听起来很棒呀！大家可以去动物收容所参观，看看被救助的猫和狗。参观完，还可以领养动物。
It sounds great! People can visit the animal shelter and see the rescued cats and dogs. After the visit, they can also adopt animals.

9.
Absolutely! We can raise more funds to benefit these animals. By encouraging people to adopt, we not only give these animals a new home but also reduce the strain on the shelter.
当然可以！我们可以筹集更多资金来帮助这些动物。通过鼓励人们领养，不仅能给这些动物一个新家，还能减轻收容所的压力。

10.
好的，这件事我可以做。我们需要找到一些志愿者，来帮我们组织这次活动。这样可以帮助我们降低预算和费用。
Sure, I can take care of this. We need to find some volunteers to help us organize the event. This way, we can help keep our budget and cost down.

11.
Yes, we'll need a group of volunteers to help plan the event details. Their support will be essential for organizing everything smoothly. By working together, we can keep our cost down and ensure the event is successful.
是的，我们需要一组志愿者来帮忙策划活动的细节。他们的帮助对顺利组织一切是非常重要的。通过合作，我们可以降低成本，确保活动成功。

好的，听起来不错！那我们可以聊聊活动的具体安排，还有怎么协调我们的工作。
Great, that sounds good! Let's talk about the specific arrangements for the event and how we can coordinate our work.

13.
Sure! We also need to get the word out about the event and aim for as many people as possible to notice it. It's important to get a big crowd to join it.
没问题！我们还需要宣传这个活动，尽量让更多人注意到它。吸引大批人参与是很重要的。

14.
我同意你的看法。我们可以约定几天后再深入讨论一下活动的细节。我也会准备一些资料，发给你们。期待我们的合作！
I agree with you. We can schedule to discuss the details of the event further in a few days. I'll also prepare some materials and send them to you. I'm looking forward to working together!

我非常高兴您打电话问我。我一直想约时间跟您见一面，聊一聊。
I'm really glad you called to ask me. I've been wanting to set up a time to meet with you and chat.

3.
You mentioned before that changing schools was a good thing for your daughter, but it seems she's encountering some issues now.
你之前跟我说, 你感觉换学校对你女儿来说很好，但好像现在她遇到了一些问题。

4.
是的，转学以后，她的成绩有提高。但是，她在社交方面好像有些困难。她到现在还没有交到任何新朋友呢。
Yes, her grades have improved since the transfer. However, she seems to be having some difficulties socially. She still hasn't made any new friends.

5.
It's great that her grades have improved; that's a very positive sign. Just give her some time to adjust to the school, and gradually she will start making friends.
她的成绩有提高是很棒的。这是个很积极的信号。就多给她点时间去适应学校吧，然后渐渐地，她就会开始交朋友了。

6.
或许吧。我有点担心她。她没有跟我说过什么，但是我知道，她感觉非常孤独。我也不希望她的成绩下降。
Maybe. I'm a bit worried about her. She hasn't said anything to me, but I know she feels very lonely. I don't want her grades to drop either.

7.
Perhaps you could help her find some after school activities that suit her. That way, she might meet some students in similar situations. What does she enjoy doing?
也许你可以给她看看有没有适合她的课外活动。这样她或许可以遇见和她有相似处境的学生。她喜欢做什么呢?

8.
她在她以前的学校参加了乐队的。她离开的时候，她还在乐队里学习。她似乎很享受乐队活动。
She was in the band at her previous school. When she left, she was still learning in the band. She seemed to really enjoy the band activities.

I think the school band is a great idea. It can give her a chance to make friends in a small group setting.
我认为学校乐队是很好的想法。这可以给她一个在小团体里结交朋友的机会。

10.
您真的说到点子上了。她以前是学吹长笛的。我可以和乐队老师确认一下，看一看还能不能让她继续学。
You've really hit the mark. She used to play the flute. I can check with the band teacher to see if she can continue learning.

11.
She could even learn a new instrument. She might also be interested in learning something new. It depends on the band's display arrangements such as the setlist and stage setup.
她甚至可以学个新乐器。她应该也会对学习新东西感兴趣。这要看乐队的演出安排，比如曲目清单和舞台布置。

12.
她马上就放学回家了。我会和她聊一聊。看她想不想尝试一下进乐队。
She will be home from school soon. I'll talk to her and see if she wants to try joining the band.

13.
Alright. You can encourage her to give it a try. Encourage her to put in some extra effort. I think that would be very helpful.
好的。你可以鼓励她试试看。鼓励她多努力一点。我觉得这会很有帮助。

14.
我同意您说的。我很难知道还能再为她做些什么了。但和您聊过以后，真的帮到我很多。谢谢您。
I agree with what you said. I find it hard to know what else I can do for her. But talking with you has really helped me a lot. Thank you.

Hi! It's nice to see you drop by. Come on in! Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
你好！很高兴看到你过来！进来吧！你想来杯咖啡吗？

2.
你好呀。给我来杯咖啡吧！谢谢你！我有一个非常让人兴奋的想法，想跟你讨论一下。
Hi! I'd love a cup of coffee. Thank you! I have an exciting idea that I'd like to discuss with you.

3.
Wow, that sounds very intriguing! I'm interested. I love to hear exciting ideas. Why not sit down and have a chat with me?
哇，听起来很有趣！我很感兴趣。我很想听听你的想法。不如坐下来我们聊聊？

4.
昨天，我遇到一位女士。她刚搬到我家对面。我突然意识到，我对住在这里的很多人，都不太熟悉。
Yesterday, I met a lady who just moved in across from my home. I suddenly realized that I'm not very familiar with many people living here.

5.
Yes, you don't say. Loads of new people have moved here over the past six months. I don't know them either.
是啊，你说得对。过去六个月里有很多新搬过来的人，我也不认识他们。

6.
下周末，我们找一个下午，举办一个聚会吧？这样可以有一个不错的机会，让大家可以互相见见面，还可以吃点东西，喝点东西。
How about we organize a gathering one afternoon next weekend? It would be a great opportunity for everyone to meet, and we can have some snacks and drinks.

7.
It sounds fantastic. I think it won't be too difficult to organize this gathering. We can just do it casually. Let's do it next weekend.
听起来很棒！我觉得组织这个聚会不会太难。我们可以随意点。我们就下周末搞吧。

8.
好的。我想，现在最重要的事情是，我们可以告诉大家，那天下午有空了就可以来参加。不需要太正式。
Great. I think the most important thing now is to let everyone know that they're welcome to join that afternoon if they are free. It doesn't need to be too formal.

9.
I still have the decorations from my last party. We can use them. I don't think we need music at the gathering. After all, our main goal is to chat and connect with each other.
我还有上次聚会的装饰品。我们可以用它们。我觉得聚会不需要音乐，毕竟我们的主要目的是聊天和互相认识。

10.
没错。最重要的事情是让大家知道聚会即将举行。我们要尽快发邀请函。
Exactly. The most important thing is to let everyone know that the gathering is coming up. We should send out the invitations as soon as possible.

That sounds really exciting! Once the invitations are ready, do let me know. I'll help you deliver them to everyone. And if I run into them, I'll be sure to mention it as well.
听起来真令人激动！一旦邀请函准备好了，记得告诉我。我帮你发给大家。如果我遇到他们，我也会告诉他们这件事的。

12.
我喜欢烹饪。我很乐意准备食物。我可能没有计划做什么特别的食物，就准备一些小吃吧。
I enjoy cooking, and I'd be happy to prepare some food. I might not plan anything special, just some snacks.

13.
We could go to the supermarket to get some supplies and drinks. I can't wait to make my favorite iced lemon tea.
我们可以去超市买一些材料和喝的东西。我迫不及待想做我最爱的冰镇柠檬茶了。

14.
太好了！谢谢你！这一定会很有趣！我很期待通过这个活动更了解我的新邻居们。
That sounds great! Thank you! This is going to be so much fun! I'm really looking forward to getting to know my new neighbors through this event.

#70161. Legal Consultation for Selling a Small Business - Legal

1.
Good morning. Thanks for your call. How can I help you?
早上好。感谢您的来电。我能怎么帮助您？

2.
早上好。我需要咨询一些法律建议。我看到你们的网站上说，你们专门针对小生意提供法律建议。
Good morning. I need some legal advice. I saw on your website that you specialize in providing legal advice for small businesses.

3.
Yes, that's correct. We provide business owners with advice on commercial and employment matters. Why do you need legal advice?
是的，没错。我们给商家提供商业和雇佣方面的法律建议。您为什么需要法律建议呢？

4.
事情是这样的：我有一个小生意和三个雇员，但我现在想要卖掉这个生意。这是一个很艰难的决定。
Here is the thing: I have a small business with three employees, but I want to sell the business now. It's a tough decision.

5.
I see. I can help you with the legal aspects of selling your business, if you like. However, you will need to handle the arrangements for the employees yourself.
我明白了。如果您愿意，我可以帮助您处理出售生意的法律事务。然而，您需要自己处理员工的安排。

6.
谢谢。我需要您帮我起草卖生意的协议。我已经找到买家了，但我的组织能力不是很好。
Thank you. I need your help to draft the sales agreement. I have already found a buyer, but my organizational skills are not very strong.

7.
Congratulations! I can help you draft the agreement. That won't be a problem. When you need to terminate the employment contracts, I can help with that as well.
恭喜！我可以帮助您起草合同。没问题的。您需要终止员工合同的时候，我也可以帮忙。

8.
不，员工希望继续为新买家工作。买家已经同意了，我也希望他们都能有个好去处。
No, the employees want to continue working for the new buyer. The buyer has agreed, and I hope they all find a good place.

9.
That would be a good outcome for all of you. I will prepare a conditional sales agreement, which will also provide legal protection for the employees.
那对你们所有人来说都会是一个很好的结果。我会起草一份附带条件的出售协议，让员工也能获得法律保护。

10.
谢谢你，这样我就放心多了。我不喜欢因为遗漏一些部分，而导致预想不到的事情发生。
Thank you. This makes me feel much more relieved. I don't like it when unexpected things happen because of missing some parts.

11.
Yes, it's always a wise decision to seek help from professionals, as drafting a sales agreement involves many considerations.
是的，寻求专业人士的帮助总是明智的决定，因为起草出售协议涉及许多需要考虑的事项。

12.
是的，我还有很多存货和设备，也需要包含在卖生意的协议里。
Yes, I also have a lot of inventory and equipment that need to be included in the sales agreement.

13.
Why don't we schedule an appointment to organize the sales agreement? If it's urgent, I'm available at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
我们约个时间来整理出售协议怎么样？如果事情紧急的话，我明天下午两点有空。

14.
太好了！明天见，期待见到您以及开始弄协议。
Great! See you tomorrow. I look forward to meeting you and getting started on the agreement.

#70160. Rental Inquiry at the Council Office - Business

1.
Good morning. Welcome to the Council Office. Please tell me how I can help you today.
早上好，欢迎来到市政厅办公室。请告诉我今天我能如何帮助您。

2.
上午好，我想要了解更多关于租房的信息。我想要住在这个地区，这里看起来是个很好的地方。
Good morning. I would like to learn more about renting a property. I want to live in this area; it seems like a great place.

3.
Yes, it is. People love to live here. There are many shops and restaurants in this area. The parks are beautiful and very close to the beach.
是的，这里确实如此。人们喜欢住在这里。这个地区有很多商店和餐馆，公园也很美丽，非常靠近海滩。

4.
太好了。我没想到这里的海滩这么棒，而且还这么近。我刚来到澳大利亚时间还不长。目前为止，我见到的所有海滩都很棒。
That's great. I didn't expect the beach here to be so wonderful and so close. I've only recently arrived in Australia, and so far, all the beaches I've seen have been great.

5.
Welcome to Australia. I believe it would be challenging to move to a new country, as many things are quite different.
欢迎来到澳大利亚。我相信搬到一个新国家会很有挑战，因为许多事情都很不同。

6.
是的，确实如此。很多事情都非常不同。如果能找到一个好的住所这会非常有帮助。如果可能的话，我想要注册一个房子或者公寓。
Yes, indeed. Many things are very different. It would be very helpful to find a good place to live. If possible, I would like to register for a house or an apartment.

7.
I'm not sure if I understand what you mean by registering for a house or an apartment.
我不太明白您所说的"注册房屋或公寓"是什么意思。

8.
在我原来的地方，市政办公室负责帮助我们注册房屋，把我们加入申请房屋的等待名单中。
In my previous place, the Council Office was responsible for helping us register for housing and adding us to the waiting list for a property.

9.
I see. That's totally different here. In general, the Council can't provide rental properties and can't help people rent properties.
我明白了。这在这里完全不同。通常情况下，市政办公室不能提供租赁房产，也不能帮助人们租房。

10.
哦，原来是这样。我不确定我现在能做些什么。我从来没有租过房子。
Oh, I see. I'm not sure what I can do now; I have never rented a property before.

11.
Real estate agencies manage rental properties. You could start by talking with them to find a suitable property.
房地产中介负责管理租赁房产。你可以从跟他们谈谈开始，寻找合适的房子。

12.
我在来的路上，看到了两家房屋中介。原来他们是负责这种工作的啊。
I saw two real estate agencies on my way here. It turns out that they are responsible for this kind of work.

13.
There are reviews of agents online. You could have a look, too.
网上有对中介的评价，你也可以看看。

14.
谢谢你的帮助。非常感谢你给我介绍了处理这件事的方法。我期待成为这个社区的一员。
Thank you for your help. Thank you very much for explaining how to deal with this matter. I look forward to becoming a part of this community.

#70159. A Lonely Transfer Student - Education

1.
Hi, thank you for coming to see me. I understand you want to talk about your daughter at her new school, right?
你好，谢谢你来见我。我知道你想谈谈你女儿在新学校的情况，对吗？

2.
很高兴您给我打电话。我一直想约您见面谈这件事。
I'm glad you called me. I've been wanting to meet with you to discuss this.

3.
I know you changed a school for your daughter. That's good for her. But it sounds like she has some new problems.
我知道你给你女儿换了学校，这对她来说是件好事。不过听起来她似乎遇到了一些新问题。

4.
是的，转学之后她的成绩提高了不少。但是在社交方面有些困难。她没交到什么朋友。
Yes, her grades have improved a lot since the transfer. But she's having some trouble socially. She hasn't made any friends.

5.
It's good that her marks improved. That's a positive sign. She may just need more time to settle in and make friends.
她的成绩有提高，这是个好兆头。她可能只是需要更多时间来适应和交朋友。

6.
可能吧。我有点担心她。她不怎么说话，但是我觉得她很孤独。我不想她的成绩再下降。
Maybe. I'm a bit worried about her. She doesn't talk much, but I think she's feeling lonely. I don't want her grades to drop again.

7.
Maybe some after-school activities will help. Is she interested in anything?
也许一些课外活动会有所帮助。她对什么感兴趣吗？

8.
她以前参加团体运动，但是后来，她之前的学校发生了霸凌事件，她就放弃了。她还挺擅长运动的。
She used to participate in team sports, but she quit after a bullying incident at her old school. She's quite good at sports.

9.
Team sports can be a good opportunity to get to know more classmates. Does the school have any teams?
团体运动是认识更多同学的好机会。学校有什么校队吗？

10.
有。我想应该有篮球队和足球队。她在以前的学校经常踢足球。
Yes. I think they have a basketball and a football team. She used to play football a lot at her previous school.

11.
That's great! She should be able to join without any problems if she played football before.
太好了！如果她以前踢过足球，加入应该没问题的。

12.
她马上放学回家了。我会和她聊一聊，让她去试一下。
She's coming home from school soon. I'll talk to her and encourage her to give it a try.

13.
Encourage her to try. It's something extra for her to do. I think it may help.
鼓励她试一试吧。这给她增加了一些额外的事情去做。我觉得这可能会有帮助。

14.
同意。之前我不知道能为她做些什么。但是和您交流感觉很有帮助。谢谢您。
I agree. I didn't know what I could do for her before but talking with you has been very helpful. Thank you.

1.
Hello, I haven't seen you since you finished your business course. What a nice coincidence to see you here!

你好。是啊。我每天在这里为我的生意采购新鲜食材。我也很高兴见到你。
Hello. Yes, I come here every day to buy fresh ingredients for my business. I'm also very happy to see you.

3.
I'm really glad to see that you have your own business. How's your business going?
很开心你有了自己的生意。你的生意怎么样了？

4.
最近很好。我刚刚搬到一个大一点的场地，在一个大商场旁边。我需要一个更大的场地。
It's been going well recently. I just moved to a bigger place, next to a large shopping mall. I needed more space.

5.
That's exciting! I want to hear more about it. Do you have time to sit and talk with me?
那很让人激动啊。我想多了解了解。你有时间坐下来跟我聊聊吗？

6.
有。在我开始工作之前还有几分钟时间。我也想和你聊聊生意上的事。
Yes, I have a few minutes before I start work. I'd also like to talk to you about business matters.

7.
Good. I'm happy to help if I can. Do you need any advice on business ideas?
很好。如果我能帮到你的话，我很开心。你需要一些关于商业点子的建议吗？

8.
嗯。现在我接到更多晚宴订单。我有个想法，我可以为其他文化做传统美食。
Yes. I'm getting more orders for dinner events. I have an idea to make traditional dishes for other cultures.

9.
Do you know what culture you want to cook for? You may need to create a list of recipes and ingredients.
你知道你想做哪种文化的菜吗？你可能需要准备一个菜谱和食材清单。

10.
是啊，不过那会很有趣。我不确定是哪种文化。我需要发掘。
Yes, but it would be fun. I'm not sure which culture it will be yet. I need to explore that.

11.
A survey of your customers might help. You don't want to serve food your customers aren't interested in.
对你的客户进行调研可能会有帮助。你也不想提供他们不感兴趣的食物。

12.
有道理。我需要考虑一下再决定。做事情没必要匆匆忙忙的。
That makes sense. I need to think it through before deciding. There's no need to rush.

13.
You're in a good position. You're doing well, and you have time to think about the next step. Now you need to work.
你现在的情况很棒。你做得很好，而且有时间考虑下一步。现在你需要去工作啦。

14.
是的。我没时间了，不过我很高兴和你谈话。感谢你倾听我的想法。
