#70191. Navigating Customer Service Challenges - Business

1.
Hi, great to see you! Come on in and have a seat. I wanted to check: how's the new job treating you?
嗨，见到你真高兴！快进来坐吧。我想问问，你的新工作怎么样？

2.
很好，谢谢！最近工作挺忙的，不过我喜欢这种忙碌的感觉，这样上班时间会过得特别快。
It's going really well, thanks! Work's been pretty hectic lately, but I enjoy staying busy. It really makes the workday fly by.

3.
Yeah, I get that. I had a chat with your supervisor, and he mentioned that you're doing great and picking things up really fast.
是啊，我理解。我和你的主管聊过，他说你表现得很棒，学东西也特别快。

4.
我很高兴他对我的工作满意。毕竟我已经干了几个星期了，现在感觉越来越有自信了。
I'm really glad to hear that he's happy with my work. After all, I've been here for a few weeks now, so I'm starting to feel more confident.

5.
The more you interact with customers, the more confident you'll get. Providing good customer service is key.
接触的顾客越多，你的信心就会越足。高质量的客户服务很重要。

6.
确实。我很喜欢跟顾客交流，帮他们找到最好的解决方案。但说实话，这并不简单。
Absolutely. I really enjoy talking to customers and figuring out the best way to help them. But honestly, it's not always easy.

7.
So true. Even if a business has a great system in place, issues still pop up. And when they do, customers tend to get even more frustrated. Have you run into any tough situations?
没错。就算生意的运营流程很好，还是会出现问题。一旦有问题，顾客往往会更不高兴。你遇到过难处理的情况吗？

8.
是的。有人把本该打折的商品按原价卖给了顾客。那位女士回家后才发现，她非常郁闷。
Yeah. Someone charged a customer full price for something that was supposed to be discounted. The customer didn't realize it until she got home, and she was really upset.

9.
Oh no! I can totally see why she'd be mad: it must've been such a hassle for her. I hope you were able to sort it out.
哎呀！我完全能理解她为什么生气，这对她来说肯定很麻烦。希望你已经把问题解决了。

10.
是的，我纠正了这个错误，退还了差价。但她还是很生气，我真不知道还能怎么做。
Yeah, I fixed the mistake and refunded the price difference. But she was still pretty upset, and I wasn't sure what else I could do.

11.
In situations like that, you could offer her a discount voucher for her next purchase. Just be sure to check with your supervisor first.
遇到这种情况，你可以给她一张下次购物的折扣券。不过要先跟你主管确认一下。

12.
哦！我明白了。如果当时我给她折扣券，她可能就有不一样的反应了。我知道她是我们的常客。
Oh! I see. If I had given her a discount voucher at the time, she might have reacted differently. I know she's a regular customer.

13.
Exactly! Keeping returning customers happy is super important. The last thing we want is a bad review online.
没错！让回头客满意真的太重要了。我们最不想看到的就是网上的差评。

14.
明白了。要是没处理好，可能会影响不好。我很高兴我现在知道该怎么给客户多多提供帮助了。
Got it. If things aren't handled well, they could have a negative impact. I'm really glad I now know how to go the extra mile for customers.
