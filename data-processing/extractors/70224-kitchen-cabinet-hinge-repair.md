#70224. Kitchen Cabinet Hinge Repair - Business

1.
Morning! I received your appointment info for today. I'm the technician checking your cabinets. What's going on with them?
早上好！我已经收到了您今天的预约信息。我是来检查橱柜的技工。哪里出问题了？

2.
您好，快请进！我厨房橱柜的门，出了点问题。铰链有些松动了，所以，门关不上了。
Hello, come on in! There's something wrong with my kitchen cabinet door. The hinge is a bit loose, so the door won't close.

3.
Got it. Older cabinets often have this issue. Let me check those hinges properly. Oh! They're completely rusted.
明白了。老橱柜常有这毛病。我好好检查下铰链。哦！它们已经完全生锈了。

4.
对的，这套橱柜已经用了很多年了，材料可能开始老化了。
Right, this set of cabinets has been in use for years and the material probably starts to wear out.

5.
These hinges are worn, and the wood around them is chipped. I need to replace the hinges and patch up the wood.
这些铰链已经磨损了，周围的木头也掉渣了。得换铰链了，还得把木头补好。

6.
好的，我没问题。如果要换新的铰链，费用是多少？还有，大概需要多长时间？
Alright, I'm fine with that. If we're replacing the hinges, how much would it cost? Also, roughly how long does it take?

7.
Replacing the hinges and reinforcing the wood frame will run you about two hundred dollars, labour and materials included.
更换铰链，还有加固木头框架，大概需要200澳币，包括材料和人工费。

8.
明白了。那您估计需要多长时间修好呢？如果能尽快完成就太好了。我今天还要准备一顿大餐。
Got it. How long do you estimate the repair will take? It'd be great if it could be done quickly. I have a big meal to prepare today.

9.
It'll only take around two hours. If you're happy with the quote, I can get started immediately. Won't mess with your big dinner plans!
大概两小时就能完成。如果您对报价满意，我现在就可以开始。不会影响你的大餐计划的！

10.
那可以。我就怕厨房用不了，所以能尽快修好就最好了。柜子坏了很不方便。
That's okay. I'm just worried about not having a functional kitchen, so I'd appreciate a quick fix. Broken cabinets are such a hassle!

11.
No worries. You'll have your kitchen back by this afternoon. I'll just grab my tools from the van, you know, drill and stuff.
别担心，你的厨房今天下午就能恢复使用啦。我这就去面包车上拿一下工具，就那些，电钻什么的。

12.
谢谢您。您修理的时候，我需要清空柜子吗？我可以在厨房做点简单的事吗？
Thank you. While you're working, do I need to empty the cabinets? Can I still do some light stuff in the kitchen?

13.
It would be great if you could empty these cabinets, so I have room to work safely. Don't use the stove for safety, but feel free to use the sink.
最好把这些橱柜清空，这样我有空间安全工作。出于安全原因，请不要用炉灶，不过水槽随便用。

14.
谢谢您的提醒，我会把橱柜里的东西都挪到一边去的。非常感谢您的专业和效率！
Thanks for the heads-up! I'll move everything in the cabinets aside. I really appreciate how professional and efficient you are!
