#70233. Excavator Theft - Business

1.
You've reached the police non-emergency line. If it's life-threatening, hang up and dial triple zero. Otherwise, I'm here to take your report.
您已拨通警察非紧急热线。如果是人命关天的事，请挂断打000。其他情况，我可以帮您记录报案。

2.
您好，我想确认下，我没打错电话吧？我要报个案子。手机查了半天，才找到这个号码。希望您能帮上忙。
Hello, I just want to make sure if I got the right number. I need to report a crime. I searched forever on my phone for this contact. Really hope you can help me out.

3.
Yep, you're in the right place for non-urgent stuff. But if it's like a robbery in progress, we can't handle it here.
对，非紧急案件打这儿没错。但要是抢劫正在发生，我们这儿处理不了。

4.
没人受伤。不是啥暴力犯罪，可是，损失挺大的。我工地的设备没了，急死我了。
No one is hurt. Not a violent crime, but the loss is bad. My construction site equipment is gone – I'm so worried.

5.
Understood. Even a small incident can be upsetting for the person involved. Don't worry, we'll get this documented.
明白。再小的事，摊到当事人身上，也让人难受。别急，我帮您登记。

6.
保险公司卡着不赔偿我，非得先要警方案件编号。不然，谁想麻烦警察啊！
The insurance company is withholding my compensation until they get the police case number. Otherwise, who would want to trouble the police?

7.
Got it. Sounds like a theft, and your insurer needs proof. Could you walk me through exactly what happened?
明白。这听起来像是被盗，而且保险公司需要凭证。您能给我讲一遍到底发生了什么吗？

8.
我是一个建筑公司的老板。昨天晚上，我的一个经理把挖掘机忘在工地上了，结果，就被偷了。
I run a construction company. Last night, one of my managers left an excavator on the site, and it got stolen.

9.
Oh dear, how awful! Is that the big machine that digs the ground of buildings, right? I know that's an expensive machine.
天哪，真糟糕！就是那种用来挖楼房地基的大型机器吧？我知道那机器很贵。

10.
是的。它用来给楼房打地基。它非常昂贵。我们给工地上锁了，但它还是被偷了。
Yes. It's for digging foundations for buildings. It's very expensive. We locked the site, but it was still taken.

11.
This type of equipment is always a prime target for thieves. Even with locks in place, they will find a way to break in.
这种设备总是盗贼盯上的目标。即使上了锁，他们也会千方百计地进去。

12.
可不嘛！幸亏买了保险。东西找不回来，至少能拿钱。不然，公司的现金流真要崩了。
Absolutely! Fortunately, we had insurance coverage. Even if the item can't be recovered, at least we can get compensation. Otherwise, the company would face a cash flow crisis.

13.
Absolutely. Now, I'll need a few more details before I can issue you a case number. You need to tell me the model, serial number and the exact location.
没错。现在我需要再了解一些细节，才能给您一个案件编号。你要告诉我机器的型号、序列号和具体位置。

14.
太感谢了！型号和序列号我让项目经理马上发邮件给您。一拿到号码，我立马发给保险公司。
Huge thanks! My project manager will email you the model and serial number immediately. I'll send this to the insurance company the second I get the number.
