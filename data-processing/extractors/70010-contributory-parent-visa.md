#70010. Contributory Parent Visa - Immigration

1.
Good afternoon, I'm John from the Department of Home Affairs. How can I help you today?
下午好，我是内政事务部的约翰。我今天能怎么帮助您呢？

2.
你好, 我想咨询一下我父母移民澳洲签证的事情。请问他们需要满足什么资格呢？
Hello. I'd like to make an inquiry about my parents' Australian immigration visa. What are the eligibility requirements, if I may ask?

3.
No problem. Your parents need to take a health examination before lodging the application. And they have to past the character test.
没问题。您父母需要在提交申请之前先做体检。他们还需要通过品格测试。

4.
我父母在国内每年都做体检，都没有什么问题。我父亲以前是个工程师, 我母亲是教师，都退休了。提供品格证明也不会有问题的。
My parents have a physical examination every year in their home country and everything's okay. My father used to be an engineer and my mother used to be a teacher. They have all retired. It won't be a problem with the character test.

5.
That's great. They may be eligible for a temporary contributory parent visa, under the premise that they have an eligible Australian citizen, permanent resident or eligible New Zealand citizen to sponsor them.
那很好。他们可能有资格申请临时付费类父母移民签证，前提是他们有符合资格的澳大利亚公民，永久居民或者是符合资格的新西兰公民来担保他们。

6.
这没问题，我是澳大利亚永久居民，我会担保我爸妈的。我来澳大利亚已经五年啦。还没想好要不要转成公民。
That won't be a problem. I'm a permanent resident of Australia and I'll sponsor my parents. I have been in Australia for 5 years and I haven't decided whether to become a citizen or not.

7.
That's good to hear. And your parents also need to meet the balance-of-family test, which means at least half of their children need to live permanently in Australia than in any other countrys.
那听起来挺好的。你的父母还需要满足家庭成员均衡测试，也就是说他们需要至少有一半的子女永久居住在澳大利亚，而不是其他国家。

8.
这一条应该也没问题。我有一个弟弟在加拿大，我和两个单身的妹妹都住在澳大利亚。所以我父母想来澳大利亚，跟他们大部分的孩子和孙子团聚。
That won't be a problem either. I have a younger brother in Canada. My two single sisters and I are living in Australia. So, my parents want to come to Australia to get together with most of their children and grandchildren.

9.
That's great. Apart from that, they must obtain an assurance of support, which can assure us that they will not have to rely on government assistance after they enter Australia on this visa. We will let you know when you need to provide it.
那很棒。除此之外，他们必须获得一个经济担保，这个可以向我们确保在他们持付费类父母移民签证入境澳大利亚以后，他们不需要依赖政府帮助。当你需要提供经济担保时我们会告诉你的。

10.
没问题。我父母有50万存款，我也愿意给他们提供经济担保。他们也不想依赖澳大利亚社会福利和政府公共医疗。
No problem. My parents have a saving of 500,000 dollars in savings and I'm willing to provide them with an assurance of support. They don't want to rely on Australian social welfare system or the government's public medical service either.

11.
They should be eligible to apply for this visa, though they may need to wait. Because there is an annual limit of quota in this category.
他们应该是有资格申请这个签证的，虽然说他们可能要等待一下，因为这个类别的签证每年都有配额限制。

12.
没问题，我回去跟我父母说一下。非常感谢您今天的帮助。
No problem. I'll let my parents know when I'm home. Thank you very much for your help today.
