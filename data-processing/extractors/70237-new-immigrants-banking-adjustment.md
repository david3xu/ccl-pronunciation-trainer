#70237. New Immigrant's Banking Adjustment - Business

1.
Hi there! Thanks for calling our bank. We're here to make your banking experience as smooth as possible. What can I do for you today?
你好！感谢致电我们银行。我们致力于让您的银行业务体验更加顺畅。今天有什么可以为您效劳的吗？

2.
我刚移民到澳大利亚不久，在你们银行开了户。现在碰到些问题，想跟您咨询下。毕竟，这边的流程和国内不太一样。
I recently migrated to Australia and opened an account with your bank. Now I've run into some issues, and I'd like to ask you. The process here is different from back home.

3.
Absolutely! Ask me anything about your bank account! I'm here to help. Banking systems do vary between countries, so it's totally normal to have questions.
当然！关于银行账户的问题尽管问我！我都可以帮您解答。各国银行系统确实不同，有疑问非常正常。

4.
确实，很多事都挺陌生的。我在努力适应了，可是，我老是担心我问的问题太傻，怪不好意思的。
Yeah, lots of things feel unfamiliar here. I'm trying to adapt, but I keep worrying my questions sound silly. It's quite embarrassing.

5.
No stress at all! When you're new to something, every question matters. We're here to help you sort things out. So, what's been on your mind?
千万别有压力！刚接触新事物时，每个问题都很重要。我们就是帮您解决问题的。所以，您遇到什么情况了？

6.
我老是搞不清楚账单什么时候该付。一忙起来，就忘了缴款。跟上各种账单的缴费实在是太难了。这问题困扰我好一阵子了。
I'm always confused about when bills are due, and when I get busy, I completely forget to pay them. Keeping up with bill payments is so hard. This has been bothering me for quite a while.

7.
Why not set up automatic payment? Just authorize direct debit. Then the bills get paid on time without you lifting a finger.
您不妨开通自动扣款？您只需要授权，然后账单会按时支付，完全不用您操心。

8.
自动扣款？听上去不错。这个功能可以在我的手机银行应用里自己操作吗？还是需要您帮我激活？
Direct debit? Sounds good. Can I do this myself on my mobile banking app? Or do you need to activate it for me?

9.
Actually, you'll need to give your payment details to the company billing you. They're the ones who manage your payment collection. I can't set that up from our end.
实际上，您需要把付款信息提供给给您发账单的公司。他们负责收款。我在我们银行端操作不了这个。

10.
知道这个方法后，办银行业务会顺手很多呀。我开始习惯网上支付了。用手机付款我也越来越得心应手啦。
Got it! Knowing this method would make banking way easier. I'm getting used to online payments now. I'm getting more comfortable with mobile payments!

11.
Our mobile app actually has multiple payment methods built in. You'll find it super convenient to handle everything on your own, such as managing all your bill payments.
我们的手机应用其实内置了好几种付款方式。您完全可以自己轻松搞定所有支付操作，比如管理所有账单的支付。

12.
手机银行是挺方便，可我偶尔还是怀念去分行找柜员面对面聊的感觉。刚来这里啥都不熟悉那会儿，这种感觉特别强烈。
Mobile banking is convenient, but occasionally I still miss chatting face-to-face with a bank teller in a branch. Back when I first arrived and everything felt unfamiliar, that feeling was especially strong.

13.
Totally get that! Just know our hotline's always open! Any confusion, give us a ring right away. We've got staff ready twenty-four seven to answer any banking questions.
完全理解！记住我们热线随时畅通！有任何不清楚马上给我们打电话。我们全天候都有工作人员，帮您解答任何银行业务问题。

14.
真的太感谢您的帮助了！您让一切变得简单多了。后续，要是遇到问题，我肯定第一时间联系您。说真的，今天您的耐心让我特别感激！
Thanks a ton for your help! You've made everything so much easier. If anything comes up later, I'll contact you first. Seriously, I really appreciate your patience today!
