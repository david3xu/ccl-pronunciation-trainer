#70209. Birthday Book Dilemma - Business

1.
Hi there! I recall seeing you a few days back when you picked up that actor's biography.
嗨！我记得几天前见过你，那时候你买了那位演员的传记。

2.
你好！我本来想把这本书当作朋友的生日礼物，可她已经买过同一本了，因为她是那位演员的头号粉丝。
Hi! I was going to give this book as a birthday gift to my friend, but she already has bought one herself because she's a huge fan of that actor.

3.
Oh dear, that's unfortunate. Since she's such a fan, it really would have made an ideal present.
天哪，那太不巧了。既然她是粉丝，这本书本来可以是件完美的礼物啊。

4.
没错，这主意原本很棒的。当时，这本书很快就脱销了，但我还是设法买到了一本。
Yes, it was a great idea. At that time, the book sold out fast, but I managed to get a copy.

5.
I'm certain your friend will appreciate the effort and thought you made picking out a gift for her, despite how things turned out.
我相信你朋友肯定能感受到你给她挑礼物时花的心思和努力啦，不管结果如何。

6.
是啊，她还是收到了一些不错的礼物的，所以也不是很有关系的。不过我现在有点不知道该怎么办，我自己是不想要这本书的。
Right, she did get some nice presents, so it's no big deal. But I'm kind of unsure what to do now. I don't want to keep this book myself.

7.
If you don't want this one, you could swap it for something different. Are there any other books your friend might enjoy?
如果你不想要这一本，你可以换成别的。你朋友或许还喜欢什么别的书吗？

8.
我只知道她喜欢那本人物传记。至于她还爱看什么其他书，我还真的不知道。与其说绞尽脑汁也可能送不到她心仪的礼物，不如我请她去吃个广式早茶。
I just know she likes that biography. As for what other books she loves to read, I honestly don't know. Rather than racking my brains and possibly still failing to give her a gift she truly loves, I might as well take her out for dim sum.

9.
That's a lovely idea as well. So, I can process a refund for you on this book.
这主意也不错。那么我可以帮你把这本书退掉。

10.
谢谢你。我真没想到这本书她已经有了，看来办理退款是最合适的解决办法了。
Thank you. I really didn't expect she already had this book. Getting a refund seems like the best solution.

11.
Alternatively, you could choose a different book for yourself. If nothing else grabs your interest, just return here for a refund.
或者你也可以挑一本别的书给自己。如果没找到喜欢的，随时回来柜台给你退款。

12.
好的。我还有一个小时才得回去上班，所以我有时间慢慢挑。你能在这么棒的店工作，真让人羡慕呀！
Alright. I still have an hour before I go back to work, so I have time to browse slowly. I envy you for working in such a great store!

13.
Thanks. I adore my job. I'm passionate about books and guiding people to find books they'll enjoy. It's a perfect job for me.
谢谢。我很喜欢我的工作。我热爱书，也爱帮人挑到喜欢的书。这工作对我来说太合适了。

14.
我能感觉到你的热情！你真是位超级棒的店员呀。你们这里的服务也确实很棒。
I can feel your passion! You really are an amazing staff member. The service here is truly great.
