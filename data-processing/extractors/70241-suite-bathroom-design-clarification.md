#70241. Suite Bathroom Design Clarification - Business

1.
Hey, the office mentioned you'd drop by to visit the site again today. I bet you'll be pleased with the progress.
嗨，办公室那边说你今天要再来工地一趟。我相信你会对进度满意的。

2.
对啊，我就在附近上班，顺路过来看看挺方便的。看着新房子一点点盖起来，我超激动的。
Yeah, I work nearby so it's easy to swing by. I'm thrilled watching my new house take shape.

3.
The crew has now finished the walls, floors, and doors. The supplier has finally delivered the materials early last week.
施工队现在已经做完墙壁、地板和门了。上周早些时候，供应商总算把材料送到了。

4.
速度真快！因为材料送过来的时间延期了，我本来还以为需要更长的时间呢。现在材料好像都很难买，运输也很慢。
That was quick! Since the material delivery was delayed, I thought it would take longer. Nowadays it seems really hard to get materials, and shipping is so slow too.

5.
True, and material prices have gone up too. Since you're here, I'd like to go over the plans with you.
没错，材料现在也涨价了。既然你来了，我想和你一起过一下图纸。

6.
没问题。我感觉我每天晚上回家都会看施工图纸。所以每个房间具体会是什么样子的，我都清清楚楚。
No problem. I feel like I check the construction plans every night when I get home. So, I know exactly what each room will look like.

7.
The plumber's working on the suite bathroom now. I just want to double-check you haven't changed the plan for it.
现在水管工在弄套房的浴室。我只是想再次确认一下你没有改那一块的图纸。

8.
我没改。我希望没有什么问题。我那个套间的浴室是围绕着一个精美的老式浴缸而设计的。
No changes. I hope there won't be any issues. The bathroom in my suite is designed around a beautiful vintage bathtub.

9.
I'll need to speak with him. He was going to include a shower in the bathroom. But he hasn't started yet. There shouldn't be any problems.
我得跟他聊聊。他打算在浴室加个淋浴。不过他还没开始弄呢。应该没问题。

10.
我很喜欢泡澡，所以我绝对不想在套间的浴室装淋浴。我们的主浴室已有一个淋浴间了。
I really enjoy soaking in the bath, so I absolutely don't want a shower in my suite bathroom. Our master bathroom already has a shower.

11.
It struck me as a bit strange this morning. That's why I inspect the site every day.
我今早上看着就突然觉得有点怪，这也是为什么我每天都要到工地检查的原因。

12.
太感谢了，让我放心多了。你这么快就能发现和解决问题，真的太棒了。
Thanks so much. That really puts my mind at ease. It's so great you can catch and fix issues promptly.

13.
Of course. I believe in looking after my customers, and I know how important it is to keep track of everything.
当然。我是客户至上的，而且我也知道每件事都把控好有多重要。

14.
设计这个房子有这么多的事情要做呀！我不知道盖一个房子需要这么复杂。
There are so many things to do when designing this house! I had no idea building a house could be this complicated.
