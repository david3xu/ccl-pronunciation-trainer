1.
Good afternoon, I'm John Wade. How can I help you today?
下午好。我是约翰韦德。今天我能怎么帮助你呢？

2.
下午好，我刚从隔壁的医生哪儿看完病过来，他给我开了这个药方，您能帮我看看，我都需要什么药吗?
Good afternoon. I just came from the doctor next door and he gave me this prescription. Could you help me see what medication I need?

3.
Sure, no problem. Have you used this prescription before or is this your first time?
当然可以，没问题。你之前用过这个处方药吗？还是说这是第一次用呢？

4.
这是我第一次用这个药，因为我的手臂有点问题，总爱起疹子，所以医生给我开了这个新药，让我试试。
It's my first time. There's something wrong with my arm and I tend to/I am prone to have rashes, so the doctor gave me this new prescription and let me try it out.

5.
Well, I have just got some feedback from other clients that this medicine is very effective. Are you taking any other medicines at the moment?
这个啊，我刚从其他顾客那里得到一些反馈说，这个药很有效。你目前有在用什么其他的药吗？

6.
是的，我还在吃心脏病的药，就是这个。我总也记不住它的名字，别人又总问我这个药，我就随身带着它啦。
Yes. I'm taking a heart medicine. Just this one. I keep forgetting its name and I'm always asked about it, so I take it with me.

7.
It's a smart idea as it may prevent unnecessary problems. Let me take a look at the medicine…well, it's safe to take these two medicines together.
这很明智，可以避免不必要的问题产生。我先看一眼药..嗯，同时用这两种药是安全的。

8.
好的，关于这个药，有什么其他我需要注意的事情吗？我有什么要忌口的吗？
Okay. Is there anything else that I should know regarding this medicine? Is there any food that I should avoid?

9.
You can eat anything you like. You just need to take two of these tablets in the morning and two in the evening with meal until you finish the full course.
您可以吃任何您想吃的。只需要早上两片，晚上两片，随餐服用，直到吃完整个疗程。

10.
好的，我会记得按时服药的。这药有什么副作用吗？因为我还要上班，我吃了药会困吗？
Okay. I'll take them on time. Are there any side effects? Because I have to work, I was wondering if I'll get drowsy after taking them.

11.
Well, there may be mild side effects, such as drowsiness. However, if you had any other symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and nausea, please contact your doctor immediately.
这个呢，可能会有轻微的副作用，比如犯困。不过，要是你有其他的症状，比如头痛，头晕和恶心，请马上联系你的医生。

12.
好的，谢谢您。您能再给我推荐一些好牌子的防晒霜给我吗？我听说在澳大利亚，不涂防晒霜有可能会得皮肤癌呢。
Okay. Thank you. Do you have any recommendations for good sunscreens? I heard that you can get skin cancer if you don't wear sunscreen in Australia.

13.
Exactly, protecting your skin from the sun is very important in Australia, some of my clients said this broad-spectrum sunscreen from Cancer Council is really good. It's at the end of aisle 4.
确实是这样的。在澳大利亚，保护你的皮肤免受太阳的伤害是非常重要的。一些顾客说这个癌症协会出的广谱防晒非常好，就在第四排货架的尽头。

14.
好的我去看看。非常感谢您的帮助，祝您有个愉快的下午。
Okay. I'll go take a look. Thank you very much for your help. Have a lovely afternoon.
