#70019. Property Investment - Business

1.
早上好，我是Joe，是一名房产投资顾问。今天我想为您介绍一套投资房产。
Good morning, I'm Joe. I'm a property investment consultant. Today I would like to introduce an investment property to you.

2.
I'm glad to meet you too. Actually, I've been searching online for a good investment property and I really need some professional advice.
我也很高兴见到你。实际上，我在网上一直在寻找一套不错的投资房产，我很需要一些专业的建议。

3.
那是当然的。在澳洲买投资房还是很复杂的，有许多细节需要考虑清楚。我想先问问您的预算大概是多少？
That's for sure. Buying an investment property in Australia can be quite complex. There are many details to consider. May I ask what your budget is?

4.
Well, I can afford a property around 700 thousand dollars, but I have no idea about the suburb selection and bank requirements.
嗯，我能负担得起大概70万澳币左右的房产，但我对于如何选择区域和银行要求一无所知。

5.
好的，70万澳币的预算还是很不错的。首先，在选择地区的时候我们需要考虑几个因素，比如房产增值的潜力，租金收益，以及附近的基础设施建设。
Alright, 700 thousand dollars is a pretty good budget. Firstly, when choosing a location, we need to consider several factors, such as capital growth potential, rental yield, and local infrastructure.

6.
That makes sense. What about the bank requirements? How much deposit do I need to pay? Do they require an income test?
这很有道理。那银行有什么要求呢？我需要付多少订金？他们需要收入测试吗？

7.
通常来说，投资房需要支付房价20%的订金。银行会审查您的收入、信用记录以及现有的债务情况。他们还会评估您的还款能力。
Generally speaking, investment properties require a 20% deposit. Banks will review your income, credit history and existing debts. They will also assess your repayment capacity.

8.
That's quite a lot of money for the deposit. Are there any government incentives or tax benefits for property investment?
订金的数额还是蛮大的。政府对房产投资有什么激励政策或税收优惠吗？

9.
是的，澳洲有一些税收优惠政策。比如说，您可以申请负扣税，这意味着如果您的投资房支出超过了租金收入，您可以用这个亏损来抵扣您的个人所得税。
Yes, Australia has some tax benefits. For example, you can claim negative gearing, which means if your investment property expenses exceed rental income, you can use this loss to reduce your personal income tax.

10.
That sounds very attractive. What about property management? I work full time and don't have time to deal with tenants and repairs.
这听起来很有吸引力。那房产管理呢？我全职工作，没有时间处理租客和维修的事情。

11.
这个您不用担心。我们可以为您推荐专业的房产管理公司。他们会负责寻找租客，收取租金，处理维修问题以及定期检查房产状况。管理费一般是租金的7-8%左右。
You don't need to worry about that. We can recommend professional property management companies. They'll be responsible for finding tenants, collecting rent, handling repairs and regular property inspections. Management fees are usually around 7-8% of the rent.

12.
Perfect. Do you have any specific properties in mind that would suit my budget and investment goals?
很好。您有什么特定的房产推荐吗？能符合我的预算和投资目标的？
