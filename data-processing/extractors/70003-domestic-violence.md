#70003. Domestic Violence - Legal

1.
Good afternoon, Ms Chen. I am the duty lawyer for the court today. I understand that you came here to apply for the family violence intervention order, right?
陈女士下午好。我是今天法庭的值班律师。我知道你今天来是要申请家暴干预令的，对吗？

2.
是的，我现在又害怕又心碎。我的丈夫经常打我，还向我大声吼叫。我今天就是想要申请一个干预令。我丈夫这已经算家暴了吧？
Yes. I'm now scared and heart-broken. My husband often beats me and yells at me. I just want to apply for an intervention order today. What my husband does can be counted as family violence, right?

3.
Yes. Family violence is behavior between family members that causes fear. It includes emotional and financial abuse, as well as physical violence and sexual abuse.
是的。家暴包括了家庭成员之间可以引起恐惧的行为。这包括情感虐待，经济虐待，肢体暴力和性虐待。

4.
好的，您这边也有我丈夫之前施暴的警察笔录吧？
Okay. You also have the police statement regarding my husband's previous violent behavior, right?

5.
Yes, according to the police statement, your husband has a gambling problem and you once had a dispute. He smashed two chairs and punched you.
是的。根据警方报告，你丈夫有赌博问题，而且你们之前有过争执，他砸了两把椅子，还用拳头打你。

6.
是这样的。我不想再去回想了。简直不堪回首。拿到家暴干预令以后我可以有哪些权利呢？
That's right. I don't want to look back. It was so unbearable. What rights can I have after getting the family violence intervention order?

7.
I understand. There are two types of order：Interim Apprehended Violence Order and Final Apprehended Violence Order. Both will protect you and your property from further harm.
我能理解的。干预令有两种：临时的暴力禁制令和正式的暴力禁制令。这两种都可以保护你和你的财产免遭更多伤害。

8.
好。警察告诉我说今天的法庭日程已经满了，我只能申请紧急的案件处理。请问你能不能给我先开一个临时的保护令?这个保护令能真的保障我的安全吗?
Okay. The police told me that the court schedule was full today and I could only apply for the case to be processed as urgent/I can only lodge/submit an urgent case application. Could you apply for an interim protection order for me first, if I may ask? Will it really protect my safety?

9.
Both orders can ensure your safety. I think it is most likely that the magistrate will grant you an interim order today. You can come for the court hearing later.
这两种都可以保障你的安全。我觉得地方法官今天更有可能给你签发一个临时保护令。之后你可以来参加法庭听证会。

10.
好的。我打算搬去我姐姐那住一段时间。但是我怕我回家收拾行李的时候，如果正好撞到我丈夫，他又要对我施暴了。有办法能保证我的安全吗？
Okay. I plan to move to my elder sister's place and stay there for a while. However, I'm worried that my husband would be violent towards me again if I come home to pack up and run/bump into him. Are there any ways to ensure my safety?

11.
Don't worry. The police will protect you and be there with you to keep you safe. However, they probably are not able to help you move to your sister's.
别担心。警察会保护你的，他们会跟你一起，保护你的安全。不过，他们可能不能帮你搬到你姐姐那去。

12.
好的，没关系。我姐姐会来帮我搬家的。我只想尽快远离我丈夫。他已经完全变了个人，我已经不认识他了。非常感谢您。
Okay, that's fine. My sister will come to help me move. I just want to stay away from my husband as soon as possible. He's totally a different person and I don't know him anymore. Thank you very much.
