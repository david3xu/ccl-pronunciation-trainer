#70219. Understanding Bill Payment Delays - Business

1.
Good morning. Thanks for reaching our bank. This is Ryan from the Customer Service Team. What brings your call today?
早上好，感谢致电我们银行。我是客服部的瑞安。您今天打电话过来是想咨询什么呢？

2.
早上好。我刚搬到澳大利亚，在你们银行开了个户。但是，这里的好多事情都让我摸不着头脑。
Good morning! I've just moved to Australia and opened an account with your bank, but I'm feeling a bit lost with how things work here.

3.
Don't worry. I'd be glad to answer any questions about your account. Loads of things here are probably different from your home country.
别担心。我很乐意回答您关于账户的任何问题。这里的很多事可能都和您原来的国家不一样。

4.
好多事情都跟之前不一样了。我正在逐渐适应呢。有时候我感觉自己的问题很傻，所以都不敢问。
Many things are different from before. I'm gradually getting used to it. Sometimes I feel my questions are very silly, so I don't dare ask.

5.
Don't worry. For many questions, our website has quick answers. But you can ask us directly if you still can't find what you need.
别担心。好多问题，我们网站上都能快速找到答案。不过您要是还找不到您要的，直接问我们。

6.
我支付每个月的账单都比较晚。我付了钱以后，还是会收到账单方的催款短信。
I always pay my monthly bills quite late. After I've paid the money, I still receive payment reminder messages from the billing company.

7.
It probably happens because you're paying on the due date. Some payments are still pending. Payments can take up to 2 days to go through.
估计是因为您踩着截止日付款。部分交易还在处理，到账最多需要2个工作日。

8.
我懂了。意思就是，钱确实从我的账户里划走了，但收款人不能马上能收到钱。
I see. So the money is definitely deducted from my account, but the recipient won't receive it immediately.

9.
Exactly. Also, it's good to note that payments made on weekends or public holidays might get delayed a bit more.
没错。另外，您需要注意的是，周末或公共假期的支付可能会多耽搁些时间。

10.
知道这些窍门后，办银行业务就能顺手多了。我现在开始习惯网上付款啦。
Now that I know these tips, handling banking tasks could be much easier. I'm getting used to online payments.

11.
Our bank's app has multiple ways to pay. You can handle the payments yourself easily, which should be very handy for you.
我们银行的应用有多种付款方式。您自己就可以轻松管理支付，这应该对您来说非常方便。

12.
有时我还是很怀念可以去分行，跟柜员当面聊一聊，尤其是碰上搞不明白的事儿的时候。
Sometimes I do miss going to a branch to talk with a bank clerk in person, especially when I'm confused about something.

13.
I get that. Just remember, our hotline is always here if you need help or have any questions.
理解。您只需要记着：您需要帮助或有问题时，我们的热线随时为您服务。

14.
非常感谢您的帮助。我现在不那么垂头丧气了。如果我还有需要帮忙的地方，我一定会再打电话给您。
Thank you so much for your help. I'm less frustrated now. If I need further assistance, I'll definitely call you again.
