#70176. Birthday Party Venue Planning - Social

1.
Hi, it's good to see you. I've bought some coffee and cakes for us.
嗨，见到你真开心。我给我们买了咖啡和蛋糕。

2.
太好了，谢谢你。我也很高兴见到你。我们有段时间没见了。
That's great, thank you! I'm happy to see you too. It's been a while since we last met.

3.
It's been way too long! It's ridiculous that we only live three streets apart! But life gets so busy. And your big birthday is coming up!
真是太久没见了！我们才相隔三条街，(居然还没见面)，真是不可思议！但是生活变得太忙了。另外，快到你的重要生日了！

4.
哦，天啊，是的。我还有很多事情要做。我还没有定场地，邀请函也还没有发出去。
Oh gosh, yes! I still have so much to do. I haven't booked a venue yet, and I haven't even sent out the invitations.

5.
I thought you were going to have it at your place? I remember we talked about it last time anyway.
我记得你说过要在家里办，不是吗？总之我记得上次我们聊过这个。

6.
原本我是这样计划的。但是客人名单一直在增加，现在还有很多家人要从海外过来。
That was the original plan. But the guest list just keeps growing, and now a lot of my family members are coming from overseas.

7.
How about the community hall? It's really nice, and I don't think it's expensive to hire. A friend of mine had her wedding there.
要不考虑一下社区大厅？那里环境挺不错的，我觉得租金应该也不贵。我有个朋友就在那儿办的婚礼。

8.
我已经有一段时间没去社区大厅了。但是我上次去的时候，我觉得那儿的厨房不太好。
I haven't been there for a while. But the last time I went there, I didn't think the kitchen was very good.

9.
Oh, it's been updated recently. It's now a commercial-grade kitchen. I think they offer a suitable catering service.
哦，那里最近升级了，现在是商业级厨房了。我觉得他们提供的餐饮服务很合适。

10.
哦，那样的话，那里可能确实是个完美的场地。因为有太多客人要来了，我肯定需要安排餐饮服务。
Oh, then that might actually be a perfect venue. Because with so many guests coming, I definitely need catering.

11.
If you need a place for your guests to stay, I have two spare rooms. I'd be happy to host your family.
如果你需要给客人安排住的地方，我家有两个空房间，欢迎你家人住我这儿。

12.
哦，谢谢你，那太好了。但是我还不确定他们想要住在哪儿。如果我确实需要额外的床位，我会给你打电话的。
Oh, thank you! That's really kind. But I'm not sure where they'd like to stay yet. If I do need extra beds, I'll give you a call.

13.
Sure! I'm really looking forward to your birthday party. Do let me know if you need help—especially on the day.
当然！我真的很期待你的生日派对。有需要帮忙的话，一定告诉我，特别是当天。

14.
我想我可能会采纳你的建议。我先把场地订好，确认好宾客名单。如果我需要帮忙，我就给你打电话。
I think I may take your advice. First, I'll book the venue and finalise the guest list. If I need help, I'll call you.
