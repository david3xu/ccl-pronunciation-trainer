#70028. Adult Migrant English Program - Immigration

1.
Hi, Ms. Wu. Please take a seat.
早上好，吴女士。请坐吧。

2.
早呀。我希望你能帮助我。
Good morning. I hope you could help me.

3.
Let's see… if the information is correct, you arrived in Australia as a refugee 2 weeks ago.
让我看看…如果信息正确的话，你是两周前以难民身份来到澳大利亚的。

4.
可不是么，但是我还是摸不到头脑。
That's right. But I still feel so confused.

5.
That's what we're here for. We have a range of programs that are designed to help you settle in Australia. First you can receive an assistance of learning English. Our goal is to help you understand everything.
我们的职责就是帮助你。我们有一系列帮助你在澳定居的计划。首先你可以接受学英语的帮助。我们的目标就是帮你把一切都弄明白。

6.
好的，我听说你们有新移民英语课程。
Okay. I heard that you have an English course for newly arrived migrants.

7.
Yes. Under this scheme, our clients can have access to a 500-hour English course, but all participants can join it voluntarily.
是的，根据这个计划，我们的客户可以上500个小时的英语课程。但是所有人都是自愿参加的。

8.
哦，我想找新工作，所以我需要参加这个课程。
Oh, I want to find a new job, so I need to take this course.

9.
Yes, all humanitarian entrants are eligible to receive assistance after newly arriving in Australia. Let's go through all the paperwork.
是的，所有的人道主义入境者都有资格在刚到澳大利亚后接受帮助。我们过一下所有的文件吧。

10.
听你这样说我就舒服多了，这里的费用太高了，我不知道如何筹谋生计，我一点积蓄都没有。
I feel much relieved to hear that. Everything is so expensive here and I don't know how to make a living. I don't have any savings.

11.
I totally understand what you are concerning, but you have access to our income support, just like other permanent residents.
我完全理解你的担心，但是你就跟其他永久居民一样，可以有得到收入补助的资格。

12.
我姑母和我表妹和我讲过，她们6个月以前就来澳大利亚了，她们知道的比我多。
My aunt and my cousin have told me about that before. They arrived in Australia six months ago and they know more than I do.

13.
That's good to hear. Do you live with them?
那很好啊。你跟她们住一块吗？

14.
没有。真是可惜呀，她们和别人住在狭小的公寓里，我和别人合租一个公寓，我希望这不要持续太久。
No. What a pity. They are living in a tiny apartment with others and I'm living in a shared apartment. I hope this won't last long.

15.
So, you'd rather live with your relatives. I can add you onto the waiting list for public housing if you meet the eligibility requirements.
所以你更想跟亲人住在一起啊。如果你符合资格要求的话，我可以把你加到公屋的等候名单里。

16.
那可太好了，我可太想和她们一起住了。
That would be great. I'm dying to live with them.

17.
I totally understand you. Well, I hope I have answered all the questions you have today.
我很能理解你。嗯，我希望我回答了你今天所有的问题。

18.
太感谢了。你真是太好了，不是所有人都像你一样。我会预约一个时间，下周二吧，我再过来。拜拜，最后再次感谢你。
Thank you so much. It's very nice of you. Not everyone is like you. I'll make another appointment. Let's make it next Tuesday. I'll be here again. Bye, and thank you again.
