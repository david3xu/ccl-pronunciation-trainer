So I don't dare ask 
quick answers 
ask us directly 
pay my monthly bills

payment reminder messages 
from the billing company 
It probably happens 
on the due date 
some payments are still pending 
take up to 2 days
to go through 
deducted 
the recipient 
it's good to note 
payments made on weekends 
or public holidays 
get delayed a bit more

online payments
our bank's app 
multiple ways to pay 
handle the payments yourself easily 
very handy for you

the city council 
dog-walking regulations
some neighbours 
get really startled 
know the rules first 
having a dog 
following rules 
straightforward regulations
to keep everyone safe 
have you had a chance 
to check any local regulations
about the details 
leash my dog 
comes to detilas 
on the beach 
I'm completely lost 
needs to be leashed 
in public spaces 
two designated off-leash parks 
they can roam 
the southern section 
of the beach 
is also leash-free
loves splashing around
in the water 
rolling in the sand 
and chasing seagulls 
any spots where dogs aren't allowed
dogs aren't allowed 
in certain spots 
like kids' playgrounds
sports ovals 
and some beaches 
look out for the signs 
before you go in 
accidenally 
don't follow the rules 
what penalties might I face 
what's the worst that could happen 
break the rules 
letting your dog off-leash 
where it's banned 
get fined 
how serious the breach is 
jumps on everyone it meets
pay extra attention 
i need to look out for 
pick up after your dog

means a fine as well
we've placed bins in most parks

sidewalks
speeding
take my kid to school
speeding past 
in his car 
the most recent time 
right at the entrance 
of our apartment complex 
risky 
do you happen to know 
the car's make and model 
or any other identifying info
a silver car 
the license plate number 
I didn't catch 
a young person 
this cocky look 
on his face 
has noticed this 
has been involved in 
any other incidents
plenty of our neighbours 
scared stiff of him 
he drives instanely fast 
the kids' safety 
dispatch 
a patrol car 
to monitor the area
pinpoint the driver 
have a word with him 
understand the consequences 
stop speeding 
to see some real improvements
to address this 
spot anything like this 
I'll keep an eye out 
this complaint 
make a difference 
we take traffic saftely 
very seriously 
in residential areas 
the complex can be safer

long time no see 
I had no clude 
you are house hunting 
been renting for years
it's time to 
have a place of my own 
I totally get it 
this area's super convenient 
with mall and part nearby 
re-learn everything all over again 
staying put would be ideal 
switch schools 
and adjust to everything all over again 
flooded with listings 
take a bit 
any luck so far 
quite a few properties 
it's over our budget 
stretch our finances 
that's a shame 
it's smart to 
stick to your budget 
plenty of fish in the sea 
an empty property 
that keeps things simple 
cluttered with 
furniture and stuff 
focus on the floor plan 
getting distracted by 
the furnishings 
the decorations
layouts
won't work for us 
a two-story home 
we prefer 
a single-level place 
be worth 
checking out 
some of the older homes 
in the area 
what you're looking for 
major renovations
tweak the layout 
not officially listed 
the owner 
can set up an inspection 
help arrange it for us 
this works out 
meet our family's needs
