#70029. Meeting a Lawyer About a Car Accident - Legal

1.
Good morning, Mr. Li. Could you explain to me what occurred to you?
早上好，李先生。您能给我解释一下发生了什么吗？

2.
您好。我出了车祸。我当时在等交通灯变绿，突然后面的车就撞上了我的车，还撞了两次。
Hi. I had a car accident. I was waiting for the traffic light to turn green when the car behind me hit my car. I got hit twice.

3.
Hit you twice? That's unusual. Were the police called to the scene?
撞了你两次？这不太常见。现场有警察来吗？

4.
是的，我们报警了。那个司机跟警察说，她当时在发短信，所以才撞了我两次。
Yes. We called the police. That driver told the police that she was texting, so she hit me twice.

5.
If she told the police that she was texting, it would be much simpler for you to win the case. Did you see the doctor after the accident? Were you injured?
如果她跟警察说她当时在发短信，你要赢这个官司就简单多了。车祸以后你去看医生了吗？你受伤了吗？

6.
是的。我去看过了。我的脖子一扭就感到刺痛。我朋友开车送我去了附近医院的急诊。
Yes, I did. I felt a stabbing pain in my neck when I turned it. My friend drove me to the emergency room in a nearby hospital.

7.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have any tests at the hospital? What did the doctor say?
听到这个我很遗憾。你在医院检查了吗？医生怎么说？

8.
医生说我的脖子扭伤了。我需要带六周的颈托，还要做三个月的物理治疗。
The doctor said my neck was twisted. I need to wear a neck brace for six weeks and receive physiotherapy for three months.

9.
Generally speaking, rear-end collision accidents are usually the fault of the driver who hit the car in front. Since she told the police she was texting, we might attempt to get a higher compensation.
一般来说，追尾事故通常都是撞前车的后车为过错方。因为她跟警察说她在发短信，我们可以试试争取更多索赔。

10.
好的，我相信你们一定会赢的，因为这很明显就是她的错。你有可能从警察那里拿到报告吗？
Okay, I'm sure you can win this case because it's obviously her fault. Do you think you can get the report from the police?

11.
I can't see that being a problem. We have a "no win no pay" policy. That means, you don't owe us anything if we lose the case. I look forward to working closely with you.
这应该不是问题。我们有一个不赢官司不收费的政策，也就是说，如果我们官司打输了，您不需要支付我们任何费用。我很期待跟您密切合作。

12.
好的，谢谢你。那我应该什么时候再来见你呢？
Okay. Thank you. When should I see you again?

13.
In two months, I think. Please see the receptionist on your way out.
我觉得，再过两个月吧。您出去的时候记得找一下前台。

14.
好的，谢谢您，祝您有个愉快的一天。
Okay. Thank you. Have a lovely day.
