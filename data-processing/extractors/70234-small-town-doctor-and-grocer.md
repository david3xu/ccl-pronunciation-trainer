#70234. Small Town Doctor & Grocer - Social

1.
Hello! Good to see you. It was a relief when you arrived after the previous doctor decided to move back to the city. We were worried about being without a doctor for too long.
你好！很高兴见到你。之前的医生决定搬回城里后，你能来真让我们松了口气。我们之前还担心会很久没有医生呢。

2.
谢谢！我很高兴能有机会接手这个诊所，为大家服务。虽然说，小镇的生活和我以前习惯的生活很不一样。
Thank you! I'm very happy to have the opportunity to take over this clinic and serve everyone. Although life in this small town is quite different from what I was used to before.

3.
We are really grateful that you came. Having a doctor right here who knows us makes all the difference, especially for the little check-ups and advice.
我们真的很感激你能来。身边有个了解我们的医生太重要了，特别是日常检查和小毛病咨询。

4.
这半年多来，我也在努力熟悉每一位病人和他们的健康情况。这种紧密的联系，在大城市的医院里，是很难建立的。
Over the past six months or so, I've been working hard to get to know each patient and their health situation. This kind of close connection is hard to establish in big city hospitals.

5.
We're lucky to have you. So, apart from the medical side, how are you finding life here overall? Anything you miss?
我们有你很幸运。那么，除了医疗工作，你觉得这里的生活怎么样？有什么想念的东西吗？

6.
整体上，我很喜欢这里的安静和友善。不过，日常生活里的一些小习惯，比如一些吃的喝的，这里的选择就少多了。
Overall, I really like the peacefulness and friendliness here. However, for some small daily habits, like certain food and drinks, the choices here are much more limited.

7.
That's where my little shop comes in! If there's something specific you need regularly that we don't stock, just tell me. I can usually get them through my suppliers.
这就是我的小店发挥作用的地方了！如果有什么你常用的，但我们店里没有的东西，直接告诉我一声。我通常能通过供应商拿到货。

8.
太好了，我们刚搬来时，买了几罐茉莉花茶和几瓶辣椒酱。但是现在，快半年了，都快见底了。
Great! When we first moved here, we bought a few jars of jasmine tea and a few bottles of chili sauce. But now, after almost half a year, they're almost gone.

9.
I heard from your receptionist that you have a really nice porcelain tea set at the doctor's clinic. You must be really missing your favourite tea and that spicy kick!
我从你前台那里听说，你在诊所有套很漂亮的瓷器茶具。你肯定很想念你最喜欢的茶和那种辣味的刺激感吧！

10.
是的啊。没有茶提神醒脑，也没有辣酱开胃下饭，我感觉我一天的工作都没法干利索。
Yes, exactly. Without tea to refresh my mind and chili sauce to stimulate my appetite for meals, I feel like I can't get my day's work done properly.

11.
Consider it done. That lovely tea set deserves the perfect brew. I'll put in an order for your preferred jasmine tea and chili sauce first thing tomorrow.
包在我身上。那么漂亮的茶具就该配上好茶。我明天一早就给你订你喜欢的茉莉花茶和辣椒酱。

12.
你真是太贴心了！小镇的人也都很好！前天晚上，诊所有个小状况，镇上几位邻居马上就来帮忙了，让我特别感动。
You're so thoughtful! The people in town are really wonderful too! Just the night before last, there was a small issue at the clinic, and several neighbors came over immediately to help. It really touched me.

13.
That's just how we do things around here. Folks look out for each other, especially for someone like you who's become so important to us all.
我们这儿的人就是这样。大家互相照应，特别是对你这样对我们所有人都很重要的人。

14.
谢谢你！就是这些点点滴滴的小事，让我觉得这里不只是一个工作的地方，更像一个可以扎根的家。
Thank you! It's these little things that make me feel this place isn't just a workplace, but more like a home where I can stay for good.
