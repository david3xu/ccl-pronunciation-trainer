1.
Hi! Thank you for calling our bank. My name is Dylan from Customer Support. Please be aware that this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes.
您好！感谢致电我们银行。我是客户支持的迪伦。请注意，为保证服务质量和培训目的，您的通话可能会被录音。

早上好。我刚收到一张账单，上面说我欠了"滞纳金"。我明明记得付过钱了！这到底是怎么回事？
Good morning. I just received a bill saying I owe a "late payment fee". I'm sure I paid it! What's exactly going on?

3.
I understand that can be frustrating. Let me check your account history for that biller. To help me, could you tell me how you made the payment?
我理解这很令人沮丧。让我查一下您对该收款方的账户记录。方便告诉我您是怎么付款的吗？

4.
我是用你们手机银行的应用付的。真怀念能去银行分行当面跟柜员聊聊啊，这样我直接拿手机给柜员看就行了。
I paid it using your bank's app. I really miss being able to just go into a branch and talk to a clerk face-to-face. Then I could just show them what's on my phone.

5.
Don't worry. Looking at the dates, it seems you paid on the due date. For some billers, the payment might not be processed until the next business day.
别担心。看日期，您好像是在到期日当天付的款。对一些收款方来说，款项可能要到下一个工作日才处理。

6.
我当天付了钱，只是处理晚了，收款方没在截止时间前收到。现在我就得付那个滞纳金？这太不合理了！
I paid on the day. It was just that the processing was late, and the biller didn't receive it before the deadline. Now I have to pay that late fee? That seems unfair!

7.
Unfortunately, that's correct according to the biller's terms. To avoid this in the future, I strongly recommend setting up a direct debit.
很遗憾，根据收款方的条款，确实如此。为了避免将来再发生这种情况，我强烈建议您设置直接扣款。

8.
直接扣款？意思是，钱自动从我的账户划走？这样安全吗？万一金额错了，怎么办？
Direct debit? Meaning the money is taken out of my account automatically? Is that safe? What if the amount is wrong?

9.
With direct debit, you authorise the biller to take the payment directly from your account. It's very secure and ensures you never miss a payment.
使用直接扣款，您授权收款方直接从您的账户扣款。这非常安全，确保您永远不会错过付款。

10.
听起来不错。那不能设置直接扣款的账单呢？比如，我的网费账单好像就不行。我还有其他选择吗？
That sounds good. What about those bills that can't be set up for direct debit? Like my internet bill, I don't think it lets me set that up. Do I have other options?

11.
You can use BPAY. It's a very common way to pay bills in Australia through online banking or our app. You'll find the unique biller code on your bill.
您可以使用账单支付服务。这是在澳大利亚通过网上银行或我们的应用来支付账单的常用方式。您可以在账单上找到唯一的收款方代码。

12.
明白了。那我下次最好提前几天付款，或者用直接扣款或账单支付服务，对吧？这样就不会再有滞纳金了。
Got it. So next time, I should pay a few days early, or use direct debit or BPAY, right? Then there won't be any more late fees.

13.
That's exactly right! You can find guides for both methods on our website or in our app. Would you like me to email you the links?
完全正确！您可以在我们网站上或应用里找到这两种方法的指南。需要我把链接发邮件给您吗？

14.
请发给我吧！谢谢你一切都解释得这么清楚。我现在知道该怎么避免滞纳金了。这样一来，办理银行业务就方便多了。
Please send them! Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I know how to avoid late fees now. This makes banking much more convenient.
