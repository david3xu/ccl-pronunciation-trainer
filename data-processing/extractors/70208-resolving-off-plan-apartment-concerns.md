#70208. Resolving Off-Plan Apartment Concerns - Business

1.
Morning, thanks for ringing in. What can I do for you today?
早上好，感谢致电。我今天能为您做些什么？

2.
您好，我在网上看到你们的网站，对地产方面有些疑问，想请您帮忙。
Hi, I came across your website online and have a few questions about property. I'd appreciate your help.

3.
Absolutely, we specialize in property law, and will do everything we can to sort out your issue.
当然可以，地产法是我们的专长，我们会尽全力帮您解决问题的。

4.
谢谢。我买了个公寓楼花，定金已经付了，可是现在我遇到大麻烦。我很焦虑，不知道怎么处理。
Thank you. I purchased an off-the-plan apartment and paid the deposit, but a serious issue has come up. I'm really anxious and don't know what to do.

5.
I totally understand. Buying real estate is a big investment, and even when things go smoothly, the process itself can be quite stressful.
我完全理解。买房是一笔大投资，就算一切顺利，过程本身也非常让人紧张。

6.
确实啊，事情不太顺利。昨天我刚和卖家签了合同。但是，我之后又发现了一些问题。
It's really not going well. I exchanged contracts with the seller just yesterday, but I believe there are some problems.

7.
Could you clarify the issues? Is it about the building itself, or maybe pet-related? We'll check the contract and resolve them for you.
您能具体说明是什么问题吗？是关于房屋本身的问题，还是宠物相关的问题？我们会查阅合同内容，为您解决问题。

8.
其实都不是。那些都没问题。我刚发现隔壁批准了一座新的公寓楼，从它那边正好能直接看到我的后院，这让我太不喜欢了。
Actually, neither. Those are all fine. I just found out they approved a new apartment building right next door that'll have a straight view into my backyard. I really don't like this at all.

9.
I understand. Since you signed only yesterday, you could invoke the cooling-off period clause to get your deposit back.
我明白了。既然您是昨天才签的合同，你可以利用合同中的冷静期条款，把定金拿回来。

10.
您能帮帮我吗？这几年我为了买房，节衣缩食地存钱，我承担不起这笔定金损失啊。
Can you please help me? I've been saving every penny for years to buy this property. I can't afford to lose this deposit!

11.
Certainly! I'd be glad to help. We can schedule an appointment to review the contract together. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
当然可以！乐意效劳。我们可以约个时间一起看看合同。您还有其他想聊的吗？

12.
我们明天见面，您有空吗？我会带着所有的文件的。谢谢您，真希望能尽快得到帮助。
Would you be available to meet tomorrow? I'll bring all the documents with me. Thank you. I really hope to get your help as soon as possible.

13.
Sure. How does 2 pm tomorrow work for you? We can go over your options then.
没问题。您看明天下午2点方便吗？到时候我们可以详细讨论您可选的方案。

14.
太好了！我的人生又有希望了！这个时间很合适。谢谢您！明天见！
That's fantastic! My life has hope again! This time works perfectly. Thank you! See you tomorrow!
