#70168. Inquiring About Spanish Lessons - Education

1.
Good afternoon. This is the language learning school. My name is Jack.
下午好。这是语言学习学校。我叫杰克。

2.
下午好。我想咨询一下给女儿安排语言课程。
Good afternoon. I'd like to ask about arranging language lessons for my daughter.

3.
Certainly. I'm happy to help. Could you tell me a bit more about your daughter and why she wants to learn a new language?
当然可以。我很乐意帮忙。您能多告诉我一些关于您女儿的事，以及她为什么想学一门新语言吗？

4.
她已经16岁了，她决定在两年后，去国外旅行一段时间。
She's 16 now, and she's decided to travel overseas for a while in two years.

5.
That sounds exciting! It's great for her to have an adventure planned and something to look forward to after finishing school.
听起来真让人兴奋！有冒险计划，完成学业后也有所期待，真棒。

6.
是的，这对她非常好。学习语言可以帮她为出国做好准备，旅游也会更轻松，还可以让她更好地和当地人交流。
Yes, it's really good for her. Learning a language will help her get ready for going overseas, make traveling easier, and allow her to communicate better with the locals.

7.
That's an excellent idea. We have several young students here. They are also learning a new language to travel overseas after school.
这是个很好的主意。我们这里有好几个年轻学生，他们也在学一门新语言，以便毕业后能去海外旅行。

8.
很高兴听到其他同学也是这样的。她准备去欧洲旅游。大部分的时间，她会在西班牙。
I'm glad to hear that other students are doing the same. She plans to travel around Europe, and she'll spend most of her time in Spain.

9.
OK. We do offer Spanish lessons. The next beginner class will be held at the end of next month. That should be good timing.
好的。我们确实提供西班牙语课程。下一期的初级班是下个月底开。这个时机应该很合适。

10.
这个…我不确定这个是不是合适。她希望下周左右就能开始上课。
Well, I'm not sure if that works. She hopes to start classes around next week.

11.
We may be able to arrange some lessons that suit her in the meantime. Why don't we meet up and discuss the options?
在这期间，我们也许可以安排一些适合她的课程。我们见面聊聊看都有哪些选择，您看怎么样？

12.
那太好了，但我们要上学和工作，很难在白天的时候见面。
That sounds great, but with school and work, it's hard for us to meet during the day.

13.
That won't be a problem. Most of the classes are in the evenings or on weekends. I'm sure we can find a suitable time.
这不是问题。大部分课程都是在晚上或周末。我相信我们能找到合适的时间。

14.
谢谢你，我会和女儿商量好时间，再打电话来预约的。
Thank you! I'll discuss a time with my daughter and call back to make an appointment.
