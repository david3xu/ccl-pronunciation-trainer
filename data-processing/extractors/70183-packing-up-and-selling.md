#70183. Packing Up and Selling - Business

1.
Hi, I am so glad you have time to meet up. It has been so long since we last met.
嗨，我真高兴你能抽空见面。自从上次见面已经很久了。

2.
是啊，抱歉我最近太忙了，我准备搬家，有太多事情要做了。
Yeah, sorry, I've been so busy lately. I'm getting ready to move – there's just too much to do.

3.
All right, I didn't know you were moving! I hope you are not moving so far. I will miss seeing you.
好吧，我还不知道你要搬家呢！希望你搬得不远，我会想念见到你的。

4.
不会的，我就搬到隔壁区，我以为我跟你说过了。我的房东把房子卖了，我不得不搬家。
Oh no, I'm only moving to the neighbouring district – I thought I mentioned it. My landlord sold the house, so I have to move.

5.
That sounds stressful. It's hard to rent a place in the area now, and the rent is more expensive.
听着挺紧张的。现在在这附近租房子很难，而且租金也更贵。

6.
是的，我新的房子更小，而且我们要交的租金还更贵。我想要卖掉一些不用的家具物品，来赚点额外的钱。
Yes, my new place is smaller, and the rent is even higher. I want to sell some unused furniture to earn some extra cash.

7.
Why not post some advertisements on social media? There are a few sites that let you do that, and it is very easy.
怎么不在社交媒体上发布广告呢？有几个网站可以发，而且操作很简单。

8.
我也许需要花一些时间来设置这些，但是好在不收钱，这对我们很重要，我们需要尽可能地省钱。
They might take some time to set up, but luckily, they're free – which is important for us since we need to save money wherever possible.

9.
It is definitely time-consuming to sell your things piece by piece, but it will be worth it, because you can make sure you get the right price for your items.
一件一件卖东西肯定很耗时，但这是值得的，因为这样能确保物品都卖到合适的价格。

10.
我也许还能拍一些照片，这样可能可以卖得更快，价格更高，尤其是家具之类的大件东西。
Perhaps I could take some photos; that might help sell them faster and at a higher price, especially for big items like furniture.

11.
It sounds like a good idea. I can help you move your things too; that may save you some moving costs, and I can help pack fragile items.
听起来不错。我也可以帮你搬东西，这样可以节省一些搬家费用，而且我还可以帮忙打包那些易碎物品。

12.
是的，我本来打算自己搬的，这样可以省点钱，能有你帮助可太棒了，谢谢你。
Yeah, I was planning to move by myself to save money, but having your help is just great – thank you.

13.
Of course, I am happy to help you load some boxes and make a few trips. Let me know when you are ready.
当然，我很乐意帮忙装箱并跑几趟。你准备好了就告诉我。

14.
你可真是个好朋友，我们大概两周之内会打包好所有东西，我到时候再给你打电话。
You're such a good friend. We'll probably have everything packed within two weeks, and I'll call you then.
