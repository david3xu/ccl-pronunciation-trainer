#70189. Helping Hands for a Neighbourhood Park - Social

1.
Good afternoon! Come in and take a seat, please. My co-worker mentioned that you were interested in our volunteer program.
下午好！请进，坐吧。我同事说你对我们的志愿者项目感兴趣。

2.
下午好！是的，我刚搬到这个社区一个月，想了解怎么更好地融入这里，多认识一些朋友。
Good afternoon! Yes, I just moved to this neighbourhood a month ago, and I'd love to find ways to get more involved and make new friends.

3.
We're always in need of more volunteers. None of our community projects would be possible without the volunteers who dedicate their time.
我们这边总是需要更多志愿者。如果没有这些热心奉献的志愿者，我们的社区项目根本无法实现。

4.
我在家工作，所以时间比较灵活。每周我能抽出几个小时做志愿者，而且也希望能认识更多人。
I work from home, so my schedule is pretty flexible. I can spare a few hours each week for volunteering, and I'd love to meet more people.

5.
Many of our volunteers end up becoming good friends. Do you have any specific interests? We can try to match you with a project that suits you.
我们很多志愿者最后都成了好朋友。你对什么特别感兴趣吗？我们可以帮你找到一个适合你的项目。

6.
我其实什么都愿意做，但我特别喜欢园艺和种植。我家里正在弄个小菜园。
I'm open to anything, but I really enjoy gardening and planting. I'm actually working on a small vegetable garden at home.

7.
That's perfect! We have a project that would be a great fit for you. We're fixing up the park near the shopping center.
太棒了！我们正好有个非常适合你的项目——修缮购物中心附近的公园。

8.
其实我前几天也注意到了，公园里的灌木丛确实需要修剪，杂草也长得到处都是，整个地方看起来不太美观。
I actually noticed that a few days ago. The bushes definitely need trimming, and the weeds are everywhere. The park doesn't look great right now.

9.
We need people with some gardening experience who can help clean up the space. Everything is overgrown and needs a lot of trimming.
我们需要有园艺经验的人帮忙整理公园。现在那里杂草丛生，需要好好修剪一下。

10.
我会修剪树枝，也懂一点园艺。公园如果整理好了，肯定会变得很漂亮。而且，它还能给社区添上一块舒适的绿色空间。
I have experience trimming branches and know a bit about gardening. Once the park is cleaned up, it'll definitely look beautiful. Plus, it'll give the community a nice green space to enjoy.

11.
There's quite a bit of work to do, but I believe the park will look amazing once it's done. We're also planning to install new benches to make it more inviting.
这项工作量不小，但等公园整理好后，肯定会焕然一新。而且，我们还计划安装新的长椅，让公园更有吸引力。

12.
公园对整个社区来说真的很重要。人们需要一个可以散步的地方，或者只是坐下来放松一下，享受新鲜空气。
Parks are really important for the whole community. People need a space where they can take a walk or just sit down and relax in the fresh air.

13.
Yes, and we're lucky to have raised enough donations to restore it. Everyone is looking forward to the reopening.
是啊，而且我们已经筹集到了足够的捐款来修缮公园，大家都在期待它重新开放。

14.
我很高兴能参与这个项目，帮助改善公园的环境。这不仅能让公园更漂亮，还能让整个社区变得更适合居住。
I'm really happy to be a part of the project and help improve the park. It's not just about making it look nicer—it'll also make the whole neighbourhood a better place to live.
