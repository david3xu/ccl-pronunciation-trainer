a variety of programs 
and activities 
for the local people 
are very diverse 
there are families 
older people
and new migrants
the local library 
is located at the center too
a lot to manage 
a busy place to work 
really enjoy this job 
help managing the center 
it's really too much for 
one person to handle
i am going to like 
the variety of my new job 
need help first 
you can take over 
all the fitness programs 
and I can't cope 
I'm swamped 
I can't handle them all
to keep organizing 
what classes are available 
cater 
strength training 
boxing 
dance 
seniors 
run 
software 
track 
do some research 
give any suggestions

the office mentioned 
you'd drop by
to visit the site
bet
progress
work nearby
swing by
thrilled
watching
take shape
the crew 
the walls
floors
doors
the supplier
delivered
the materials
early last week 
the material delivery 
was delayed
take longer 
nowadays
really hard 
to get materials 
shipping
the material prices 
have gone up 
go over 
the plans
No problem at all 
check 
the construction plans
blueprints
get home 
I know exactly 
the workers delivered 
the kitchen cabinet 
and benchtop
be installed 
on the sidewall 
go there 
That way 
cook
at the same time 
look at the view 
through the side window 
natural light 
is too short 
change it back 
for a longer one 
that's troublesome 
the wrong color
that's fine 
the size is wrong 
definitely won't work
It struck me 
as a bit strange 
inspect 
puts my mind at ease 
you can catch 
you can spot 
and fix issues
promptly 
I believe in 
looking after my customers 
how important it is 
keep track of everything
when designing this house 
involves 
so many things to do
I had no idea 
building a house 
could be this complicated

70246
we've finally 
got a chance 
to catch up 
it's been ages
since we last sat down 
to enjoy coffee and chat 
to relax over coffee and talk 
we haven't had a chance 
in so long 
how's your day going
mentioned
you were browsing 
the mall 
before coming here 
a new lounge chair 
I just want to buy 
i've been looking around 
that feels really nice 
That's awesome 
big stores 
have loads of options
depending on what you want 
I spotted 
a cream-colored 
leather sofa 
that i really like
which payment method 
makes the most sense 

70236
come on in 
I heard
you were asking about
volunteering opportunities 
get involved 
i just moved here 
trying to find things to do
to get to know the area sooner 
it's a new place 
meet more neighors
looking for people
to help out with our activities
we do here 
my schedule's pretty flexible
spare a few hours 
match you with a project 
suits
your hobbies 
a little veggie garden 
an ideal project 
fixing up the park 
next to the mall 
your skills 
a great fit 
an empty lot 
helpers
look after 
the seedlings
in our shed 
planting 
native plants
i can tell 
it's fixed up 
a big project for sure 
it'll be worth it 
be installing 
some benches 
can relax there 
parks 
a spot 
to take walks 
sit and git some fresh air 
definitely 
we got really lucky 
to have raised 
lots of community donations
to restore the part 
the whole neighbourhood's 
keen to see it open again 
a sense of accomplishment

customer support 
calling our bank 
may be recorded 
for quality and training purposes 
paid a bill 
through mobile banking 
i received 
a late fee notice 
look into this issue 
which bill you paid 
made the payment 
the electricity bill 
on my phone 
the due date 
have paid it on time 
your concern 
let me check 
the payment processing time 
for your transaction 
there can be delays 
between when you submit 
and when it's processed 
when i clicked pay 
the money would be transferred 
submit a payment 
it goes into a queue 
for processing 
it takes 1 - 2 business days 
to complete 
we recommand 
paying a few days early 
from now on 
can you waive this late fee 
before the due date 
i'll waive the late fee 
set up 
direct debit 
to avoid this 
in this future 
how does that work?
your account details 
and authorize us 
to automatcially deduct 
the payment amount 
on the due date 
processed on time 
fill out any forms 
do it online 
entirely online 
through our website 
i'll send you 
a link to the direct debit form 
it only takes 
a few minutes to set up 
this way i won't have to worry

It was a relief 
move back to the city 
we were worried about 
being without a doctor 
to have the opportunity
