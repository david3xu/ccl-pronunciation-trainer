#70199. Parent's Call for Disability Holiday Program Details - Social

1.
Hi. You have reached the Disability Support Program hotline. How may I assist you today?
下午好，您已拨通残疾人支持项目热线，请问今天有什么我可以帮忙的吗？

2.
你好，我是孩子的家长，最近听说了你们的一个为残疾儿童设计的假期项目，我想了解更多详细情况。
Hello, I am the parent of a child, and I recently heard about your holiday program designed for children with disabilities. I would like to learn more details.

3.
I'd be happy to help. I'm one of the coordinators for this program. Could you tell me how you found out about it?
我很乐意帮忙，我是这个项目的协调员之一。请问您是怎么得知这个项目的呢？

4.
我儿子在一家医院参加体育训练。就在这个礼拜，我在医院的公告板上注意到了一张你们介绍这个假期项目的海报。
My son is currently taking part in sports training at a hospital, and just this week, I noticed a poster on the hospital notice board about your holiday program.

5.
I'm glad that you noticed the poster. We don't promote it broadly since our support is limited to a few families annually.
我很高兴您看到了那个海报。我们不大范围宣传，因为每年我们只能帮助少数几个家庭。

6.
我懂的。现在我想清楚点了解一下这个残疾儿童假期计划是怎么运作的。因为海报上明确写着，这个假期完全免费的。
I understand. Now, I would like to clearly know how this holiday program for children with disabilities operates, as the poster clearly states that this holiday is completely free of charge.

7.
There's indeed no charge. We provide a spacious house by the beach free of cost. It can accommodate two families simultaneously.
确实不需要支付任何费用。我们会免费提供一栋很大的靠近海滩的房子，可以同时容纳两个家庭。

8.
那真是太好了！我儿子特别喜欢海滩。但是我们家有四口人，如果能安排两间房间，就再合适不过了。
That's really great! My son especially loves beaches. But there are four of us in the family, having two bedrooms would be just perfect.

9.
Every family is assigned two bedrooms along with its own private bathroom. We also supply food for shared cooking and dining, which gives you the chance to connect with new people.
每个家庭都会配备两间卧室和独立的浴室。我们还会提供食材，让大家可以一起做饭和就餐，这样你们有机会认识新朋友。

10.
太好了。这样的话，我们就有机会认识其他的家庭了！我儿子也能认识一些能理解他的情况和一起分享相似经历的朋友。
That's great. That way, we will have the opportunity to connect with other families, and my son can make friends with those who understand his situation and share similar experiences.

11.
He can make new friends so sure, and you'll also get support from fellow parents. Would you like to proceed with the application now?
他一定会交到新朋友，您也能从其他家长那里获得支持。您现在要办理申请吗？

12.
要的，非常感谢。我已经好久没有和家人一起度假了，希望这个申请过程不要太繁琐，让我们可以轻松享受这次假期。
Yes, thank you very much. I haven't taken a family vacation for a long time, and I hope this application process won't be too complicated so that we can easily enjoy the holiday.

13.
It won't be at all. It's very simple, with just a single form to fill out. Once you complete it, we'll contact you to schedule your holiday date.
一点也不复杂的。非常简单。只需要填写一张表格。您一填完表，我们就联系您确定度假日期。

14.
非常感谢您的帮助。我真的很期待这次假期，我儿子也肯定会非常兴奋的。也感谢您组织了这么棒的项目。
Thank you so much for your help. I'm really looking forward to this holiday; my son is definitely going to be very excited. And thank you for organizing such a wonderful program.
