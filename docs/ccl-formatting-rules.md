# CCL Pronunciation Training Formatting Rules

## Overview
This document defines the formatting rules for CCL (Community Languages Credentialing) pronunciation training materials. The goal is to create meaningful, manageable chunks of English text that facilitate effective pronunciation practice.

## Core Rules

### 1. Term Definition
- A **term** = content within `_xxx_` (between underscores)
- Each term should contain **3-7 natural words**
- Terms are separated by ` | ` (pipe with spaces)

### 2. Word Count Requirements
- ❌ **Too short**: 1-2 words per term
  - Examples: `_I'm_`, `_a_`, `_tools_`, `_stolen_`
- ✅ **Perfect**: 3-7 words per term
  - Examples: `_I'm a construction worker_`, `_working on a site_`
- ❌ **Too long**: 8+ words per term
  - Example: `_My car parked at the site was broken into completely_`

### 3. Meaningful Content Rule
Each term must be **semantically meaningful** and represent a complete thought or natural phrase unit.

#### Bad Examples (Not Meaningful):
- `_into, and all my_` (cuts mid-sentence, incomplete)
- `_the site was_` (incomplete thought)
- `_broken into, and_` (awkward boundary)

#### Good Examples (Meaningful):
- `_and all my tools were stolen_` (complete thought)
- `_the site was broken into_` (complete passive construction)
- `_I just can't believe it_` (complete emotional expression)

### 4. Word Preservation Rule
- **NEVER lose any words** when splitting/combining
- **ALWAYS preserve all original content**
- Only change the grouping within underscores, not the words themselves
- Maintain original punctuation and capitalization

### 5. Natural Phrase Boundaries
Split at natural linguistic boundaries to maintain speech flow:

#### Preferred Boundaries:
- **Complete noun phrases**: `_a construction worker_`, `_my car_`
- **Complete verb phrases**: `_working on a site_`, `_was broken into_`
- **Prepositional phrases**: `_at the site_`, `_on a site_`
- **Complete clauses**: `_I just can't believe it_`
- **Coordinated elements**: `_and all my tools_`

#### Avoid Breaking:
- Determiner + noun: Keep `_the site_` together
- Auxiliary + verb: Keep `_was broken_` together
- Preposition + object: Keep `_on a site_` together

### 6. Formatting Standards
- Use ` | ` (pipe with spaces) to separate terms
- Each term wrapped in `_content_`
- Maintain punctuation within terms when it belongs to that phrase
- Preserve sentence-ending punctuation in the last term of each sentence

## Examples

### Before (Violations):
```
I'm a _construction worker_, | working on _a site_. | My _car parked_ at the site was _broken into_, | and all my _tools_ were _stolen_. | I just _can't believe it_.
```

**Issues:**
- `_a site_` (2 words - too short)
- `_car parked_` (2 words - too short)
- `_tools_` (1 word - too short)
- `_stolen_` (1 word - too short)

### After (Correct):
```
_I'm a construction worker_, | _working on a site_. | _My car parked at_ | _the site was broken into_, | _and all my tools were stolen_. | _I just can't believe it_.
```

**Verification:**
1. `_I'm a construction worker_` = 4 words ✅ (complete noun phrase)
2. `_working on a site_` = 4 words ✅ (complete verb phrase)
3. `_My car parked at_` = 4 words ✅ (meaningful phrase)
4. `_the site was broken into_` = 5 words ✅ (complete passive construction)
5. `_and all my tools were stolen_` = 6 words ✅ (complete thought)
6. `_I just can't believe it_` = 5 words ✅ (complete emotional expression)

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any CCL formatting, verify:

- [ ] All terms contain 3-7 words
- [ ] Each term is semantically meaningful
- [ ] No words are lost from the original text
- [ ] Terms break at natural linguistic boundaries
- [ ] Punctuation is preserved appropriately
- [ ] The text maintains natural speech flow for pronunciation practice

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Word Loss**: Accidentally dropping words during reformatting
   - ❌ **Example**: Original: `I didn't know that before. | I'm excited to vote! | I'll check the website and enroll.`
   - ❌ **Wrong**: `I _didn't know that_ before. | I'm _excited to vote_! | I'll _check the website_ and _enroll_.`
   - ✅ **Correct**: `I _didn't know that before_. | I'm _excited to vote_! | I'll _check the website and enroll_.`
   
2. **Missing Content**: Losing entire words or phrases when splitting/combining
   - ❌ **Example**: Original: `I'm a construction worker, working on a site.`
   - ❌ **Wrong**: `a _construction worker_, | _working on a site_.` (lost "I'm")
   - ✅ **Correct**: `_I'm a construction worker_, | _working on a site_.`

3. **Underscore Removal**: Removing underscores when combining terms
   - ❌ **Example**: `_check the website and enroll_` (lost individual word highlighting)
   - ✅ **Correct**: Each word should maintain emphasis for pronunciation training

4. **Arbitrary Splits**: Breaking at unnatural points that harm comprehension
5. **Ignoring Meaning**: Creating terms that are grammatically incomplete
6. **Count Only Focus**: Focusing only on word count without considering meaning

## Purpose
These rules ensure that CCL pronunciation training materials provide:
- **Effective Practice**: Meaningful chunks for pronunciation work
- **Natural Flow**: Segments that reflect actual speech patterns
- **Manageable Size**: Neither too short nor too long for effective practice
- **Complete Understanding**: Each term contributes to overall comprehension
