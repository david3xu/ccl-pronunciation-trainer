# Azure workload plan

Status: implementation plan; infrastructure is not yet compiled or deployed
Scope: subscription `6dff91eb-4b81-48c9-8c99-340b5d793568`, spanning ccl-pronunciation-trainer, datacore-platform and contextpatch.

Companion documents: `docs/operations/azure-workload-plan.md` in datacore-platform; `docs/azure-workload-position.md` in contextpatch.

> **Implementation authority.** The target set, canonical implementation sequence and implementation todos in this document are authoritative. Historical alternatives have been removed so they cannot override the selected App Service S1 and handler-first path.

## Direction

The trainer consolidates onto Azure. The five confirmed third-party providers are retired and replaced with Azure equivalents; `resend` remains conditional until its production use is verified.

### Complete third party inventory

Audited 6 August 2026 across the repository excluding `node_modules`, `dist`, `ios` and `data`.

| Third party | Role | Azure replacement | New workload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supabase | database, sync | Database for PostgreSQL | yes |
| Supabase | auth | Entra External ID | no, free MAU tier bills zero |
| Gemini | AI chat, recommendations, scoring | Foundry | no, already counted |
| Vercel | static `dist` build hosting | App Service S1 | yes |
| Vercel | the six `api/` HTTP handlers | App Service S1 | no, same App Service workload |
| PostHog | product analytics, optional per `src/env.d.ts` | Application Insights | no, same service as telemetry |
| Sentry | error tracking | Application Insights | no, same service |
| resend | transactional email, single reference only | Communication Services | conditional, verify first |

Only two replacements add new service types to the target tally: App Service and Database for PostgreSQL. The other confirmed migrations consolidate onto services already in the set. That is expected: consolidation and the milestone are separate objectives that happen to overlap.

**One real benefit.** Application Insights becomes the common destination for server telemetry, product analytics and error reporting. It remains a retained, uncounted service rather than part of the six-service target.

**resend needs verification.** It appears exactly once, so it may be aspirational rather than wired. If transactional email is genuinely in use, Communication Services becomes an additional Azure service. If not, do not provision it to pad the count.

This is a product direction decision, not a milestone decision. The milestone benefits from it, but the reverse justification would be backwards and is not the reason recorded here.

## Objective

Reach the Microsoft for Startups $25,000 credit milestone. Requirement is five or more distinct Azure services, each above US$1 in spend, held for 60 continuous days. Six are targeted: five with fixed or base monthly floors, plus usage-controlled Foundry.

The milestone matters mainly for the one-time two year credit extension attached to it, not the headroom.

## Binding constraint

Spend and schedule, not architecture.

| Fact | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Consumed 1 to 6 August | A$986.15, almost entirely Foundry in `rg-openclaw-ai` |
| August forecast at unthrottled rate | A$2.58K |
| Credits remaining | US$3,633, no spending limit, Azure Plan |
| Planned steady rate after redesign | ~US$296/mo, about US$9.87/day |
| Runway at planned rate | over twelve months |
| Credit expiry | 22 December 2026 |
| Milestone clock | not started; T0 requires Cost Management verification |

**The exhaustion problem is gone.** At roughly US$296 a month the US$3,633 balance lasts just over a year, so credits now outlive both the 60 day window and the 22 December expiry. Expiry becomes the binding constraint again, which means the milestone's two year extension is what preserves the unused remainder rather than merely funding the window.

This only holds if Foundry is throttled. Left alone it consumes the entire balance by roughly 9 September and the redesign is moot.

Throttling Foundry to a deliberate floor near US$2 a day does double duty: it is the cost control, and it guarantees that workload stays above the daily threshold rather than drifting below it.

**The consolidation must not gate the clock.** Auth migration alone is multi-week work. Resource provisioning and cost verification may run in parallel with repository implementation, but they do not change the code dependency order below. A service counts as genuinely in use from the point it becomes a live migration target, not merely when it is provisioned.

## Current countable state

One workload.

| Resource | Type | Counts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rg-openclaw-ai-instance` | Foundry account | yes |
| `proj-datacore-platform` | child project of the above | no, no independent meter |
| `ccl-pronunciation-speech-david` | Speech, SKU `F0` | no, free tier bills zero |
| `syntiondevdavidxu.onmicrosoft.com` | Entra External ID | no, free tier |

## Counting rule, and why distinct types

The published definition says each unique service counts as one workload. It does not document whether Microsoft counts by service name, product, meter category, or deployed resource. The ambiguity is open on Microsoft Q&A without a definitive answer.

Distinct service types satisfy both readings. Multiple resources inside one service only satisfy the permissive one. The plan uses distinct types throughout.

Spend margin is not the safety mechanism; billing model is. A service averaging US$2 a month sits at seven cents a day and fails a daily reading regardless. Fixed monthly floors cannot drop. Consumption services clear the floor only if real traffic passes through them.

## Spend floor interpretation, decided

**Every counted service must clear US$1 per day, not US$1 per month.** Approved 6 August 2026 as the design assumption.

This is the strict reading of an ambiguous rule and it inverts the whole design. A service must cost roughly US$30 a month or more to qualify, which disqualifies every cheap tier. Optimising for low cost, which the earlier drafts of this plan did, actively defeats the requirement.

Disqualified by this decision, all of them previously in the target set:

| Service | Previously chosen tier | Per day | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Static Web Apps | Standard, $9/mo | $0.30 | fails |
| Container Registry | Basic, $5/mo | $0.17 | fails |
| Blob Storage | Hot, ~$5/mo | $0.17 | fails, would need roughly 1.6TB stored |
| Database for PostgreSQL | B1ms, ~$15/mo | $0.50 | fails, needs sizing up |
| Application Insights | usage | marginal | needs roughly 360MB/day ingestion |
| AI Speech | S0 usage | marginal | needs roughly 65k characters/day |

The cost of the strict reading is roughly six times the lenient one. See open question three: the documentation does not state which applies, and confirming it before committing is worth about US$300 over the window.

## Target set

Six services, roughly **US$296 a month**, each with a floor that clears US$1 per day. Five are required for the $25,000 milestone, so this carries one workload of buffer.

**Approved ceiling: US$400 a month.** The margin above US$296 is not slack. Foundry is entirely usage billed and Front Door can add usage and WAF charges above its base fee. Speech is also usage billed but is outside the six-service target. Every figure below is estimated from memory of list prices, so overshoot is likely rather than possible.

| # | Service | Tier | Est. USD/mo | Est. USD/day | Floor holds because |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | App Service | Standard S1 | 70 | 2.33 | fixed compute charge |
| 2 | Database for PostgreSQL | B2s plus 64GB | 40 | 1.33 | fixed vCore plus storage |
| 3 | Front Door | Standard | 35 | 1.17 | fixed base fee |
| 4 | Cache for Redis | Basic C1 | 41 | 1.37 | fixed tier charge |
| 5 | API Management | Developer | 50 | 1.67 | fixed instance charge |
| 6 | Foundry | throttled to a deliberate floor | 60 | 2.00 | directly controlled |

Estimate only, from memory of Azure list prices. Price each in the calculator for `australiaeast` before provisioning. The API Management estimate assumes Developer; if IN-07 selects another tier, reprice the total and confirm it remains below the approved ceiling.

### Justification, not just price

A price tag is not a reason. Each entry has to survive the program's genuine use condition.

* **App Service S1** replaces Static Web Apps for the `dist` build. Chosen over Basic B3 at US$55 deliberately: four cores serving static files invites the charge of being contrived, whereas deployment slots, autoscale and backups are defensible on capability. It also absorbs the six `api/` HTTP handlers.
* **PostgreSQL B2s** replaces the Supabase database. Sized up from B1ms purely to clear the daily floor; B1ms would be adequate on load alone.
* **Front Door Standard** replaces the CDN slot for audio delivery and provides managed TLS and edge routing. WAF is intended but is not present in `infra/azure/front-door.bicep`; a policy and endpoint association must be added before public cutover, and its separate charges must be included in the calculator estimate.
* **Cache for Redis C1** caches Foundry responses for repeated vocabulary items. In a study app many users hit the same words, so this genuinely reduces inference cost. Also carries session state and rate limiting.
* **API Management Developer** fronts the handlers during migration with policy enforcement and throttling. Developer has no SLA and is not an automatic production choice; production cutover requires an explicit decision to accept that risk temporarily or move to an available SLA-backed tier.
* **Foundry** replaces Gemini and is throttled to a deliberate floor rather than left to run.

Redis and API Management are the two most vulnerable to a charge of being contrived. Removing Redis leaves five target services at roughly US$255 a month; removing API Management leaves five at roughly US$246. Removing both leaves four at roughly US$205 and no longer satisfies the five-service objective without a justified replacement.

### Retained but not counted

Retain Blob Storage, AI Speech at `S0`, Application Insights and datacore's Container Registry only for their product roles. They are not part of the six-service target. If Microsoft confirms a cumulative floor, count one only after Cost Management shows that service has actually crossed the required spend; do not assume that a provisioned low-cost resource qualifies.

Entra External ID replaces Supabase auth and bills zero on the free monthly active user tier. Consolidation only.

Communication Services replaces `resend`, conditional on verifying that transactional email is genuinely in use.

Trainer resources use `australiaeast` except global Front Door. Tag every resource by product; two products share this subscription.

## Consequence for datacore

The trainer now needs Postgres for its own reasons, which resolves the open decision in `docs/operations/azure-workload-plan.md` in datacore-platform. datacore keeps its compose Postgres and its local-first property. It contributes Container Registry and Foundry only.

Sharing one Postgres server between an event-sourced write path and a consumer app is still not advisable. The trainer uses its own B2s server; sharing would count once either way.

## Migration inventory

Work required by the all-Azure direction, largest first.

### Auth, Supabase to Entra External ID. Largest item.

Touches `src/services/supabase/authService.ts`, `supabaseClient.ts`, and every call site that assumes a Supabase session. No drop-in equivalent exists. An Entra External ID tenant already exists at `syntiondevdavidxu.onmicrosoft.com`, though it was provisioned for a different purpose and its suitability needs checking before reuse.

Expect this to dominate the schedule. It does not block the clock.

### Database, Supabase to Azure PostgreSQL

Touches `supabase/migrations/`, `src/types/database.ts`, `src/services/supabase/syncService.ts`, `autoSyncManager.ts`, `src/services/migration/migrationService.ts`. Schema translation is mechanical; the sync layer assumptions are not.

Provision early. Postgres has a fixed floor and begins counting immediately.

### Hosting and handlers, Vercel to App Service

App Service S1 is the single target for both the Vite `dist` build and all six `api/` HTTP handlers. Static Web Apps is not part of the selected design.

The first application deliverable is a Node 22 production runtime that serves `dist`, provides SPA fallback routing, exposes `/health`, and hosts `/api/*`. Handler business logic is extracted from `VercelRequest` and `VercelResponse` behind framework-neutral interfaces before the routes move.

Migrate `/api/voices` first to prove packaging, startup, routing, telemetry and APIM proxying. Then move the remaining handlers (`ai-recommendations.ts`, `ai/chat.ts`, `audio/generate.ts`, `premium-tts.ts`, and `pronunciation-score.ts`) as one compatibility-tested API surface. `config.ts` and `azureSpeech.ts` are shared modules, not HTTP handlers, and move with their consumers.

Vercel remains available only as a rollback target during cutover. It is not a PostgreSQL client: the browser never connects directly to PostgreSQL, and PostgreSQL networking permits the App Service backend rather than Vercel egress.

### Analytics and error tracking, PostHog and Sentry to Application Insights

Touches `src/services/analytics/analyticsService.ts` and the `VITE_POSTHOG_API_KEY` and `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` declarations in `src/env.d.ts`, both currently optional. Sentry appears once and may not be wired; verify before planning removal work.

Small change that establishes one observability path. Baseline server telemetry lands with the App Service vertical slice; product analytics and error migration complete in Phase 5.

### Email, resend to Communication Services. Verify first.

Single reference in the repository. Establish whether transactional email is actually in use before provisioning anything. If it is, Communication Services is an additional Azure service. If it is not, skip it; provisioning an unused service to raise the count is the exact case the program's genuine use condition excludes.

### AI, Gemini to Foundry. Lowest priority.

Touches `src/services/ai/` throughout: `recommendationService.ts`, `recommendationEngine.ts`, `ratingService.ts`, `interventionEngine.ts`, `weakAreaDetector.ts`, `taskPersonas.ts`, plus `api/ai/chat.ts` and the `gemini.*` config keys (`defaultModel`, `maxTokens`, `temperature`, `topP`, `topK`), currently on `gemini-2.5-flash`.

**Sequence this last.** Foundry is already counted, so this yields zero additional workloads while adding inference load to a service controlled by the separate operations throttle. It is a consolidation goal, not a milestone contributor.

### Audio, new work rather than migration

Blob becomes the server-side cache for generated TTS, touching `api/audio/generate.ts` and `src/services/audio/audioCache.ts`, with Front Door serving `/audio/*` and client URLs repointed. Blob is retained but not counted; Front Door is in the target set.

## Explicitly rejected

Recorded so these are not re-litigated.

* **contextpatch gets nothing.** Six dependencies, no HTTP client, no async runtime, no network stack. That hermeticism is the security posture of a binary that mutates the source tree behind an allowlist. See `docs/azure-workload-position.md` in that repository. The all-Azure direction does not extend to it.
* **No datacore cloud migration.** Ruled out by `vision.md`, `v1-scope.md` and `plan.md`, the last of which requires a superseding ADR. Workers bind to local git worktrees, so a full move is a different product.
* **Provisioned but unused Redis.** Redis is not complete until an App Service handler uses it for rate limiting, session state or Foundry response caching. A cache with no local consumer does not satisfy the product design.
* **Service Bus or any broker.** `manager-sdk/src/fanout.ts` is `Promise.all`. Nothing queues.
* **Blob for datacore `artifact_paths`.** That field holds references to local worktree paths in the event envelope schema, not upload targets. Off-host backup of the event store is the real datacore Blob case.
* **AI Search.** Basic tier around US$75, free tier bills zero, and pgvector in the Postgres being provisioned covers vector needs.
* **Key Vault as a counted workload.** Genuinely useful, but standard tier needs roughly 330,000 operations to reach a dollar. Adopt it if wanted; do not count it.
* **Static Web Apps.** Standard fails the selected daily floor and duplicates the App Service host.
* **Container Apps as a counted workload.** The monthly free vCPU and memory grant can absorb a small always-on replica entirely. App Service S1 is the selected host.
* **Counting Entra External ID.** Free monthly active user tier means it bills zero at current scale.
* **Sharing the datacore Postgres with the trainer.** Counts once either way.

## Canonical implementation sequence

This sequence governs repository work. Cost controls and milestone verification run as a separate operations track and do not change code dependencies.

### Phase 0, validate the deployment contract

Compile every Bicep module and correct unsupported API versions or properties. Remove the transitional `handlerBackendUrl` and Vercel firewall inputs: APIM derives its backend from the App Service output, and PostgreSQL permits the App Service backend.

Before deployment, verify every selected SKU is offered to this subscription in `australiaeast`, check quota and provider registration, and confirm the exact supported App Service Linux runtime string for Node 22. Define the startup command, deployment artifact, server-only settings, service permissions, APIM operations, CORS policy and production origins. Add and associate the Front Door WAF policy rather than treating WAF as an implicit Standard feature.

Exit criteria: selected SKUs and the Node runtime are available, `main.bicep` compiles, a deployment what-if succeeds, required human inputs are recorded, Front Door security is explicit, and no runtime URL or secret is hard-coded into client code.

### Phase 1, deliver an App Service vertical slice

Add the production server on the supported Node 22 App Service runtime selected in Phase 0, serve the Vite build with SPA fallback, expose `/health`, introduce framework-neutral handler contracts, and port one low-dependency API route. Add baseline Application Insights telemetry.

Exit criteria: App Service serves the application, a deep link, `/health`, and one API route; APIM proxies that route; browser and Capacitor builds can select the Azure API origin.

### Phase 2, move the complete API surface

Port the remaining Vercel handlers, centralize validation and error responses, define APIM operations and rate limits, and make Azure-target web and Capacitor builds use APIM without changing the production default yet. Do not put an APIM master subscription key in browser code.

Exit criteria: all six routes pass compatibility tests through APIM, Azure-target clients use APIM, direct App Service access is restricted as designed, and Vercel remains a tested production rollback path until Phase 6.

### Phase 3, move persistence to PostgreSQL

Translate the Supabase schema, introduce server-side repositories, move sync calls behind the API, migrate data, reconcile record counts and perform a controlled cutover. Preserve offline and guest behavior.

Exit criteria: production reads and writes use PostgreSQL through App Service, no browser has database credentials, reconciliation passes, and a rollback procedure has been exercised.

### Phase 4, move auth to Entra External ID

Replace Supabase types at the application boundary with provider-neutral auth contracts, implement Entra client flows, validate JWTs in the API, map existing user identities and preserve guest mode.

Exit criteria: sign-up, sign-in, refresh, sign-out, protected API access and account recovery work on web and Capacitor; existing progress remains attached to the correct user.

### Phase 5, complete Azure service integrations

Wire Blob and Front Door for audio, replace PostHog and Sentry with Application Insights, then replace Gemini with Foundry and add Redis caching. Cache keys include model, prompt version and generation settings; user-specific conversations are not shared-cache entries.

Exit criteria: audio is served through Front Door, telemetry and errors arrive in Application Insights, AI requests use Foundry, and Redis has a measured application consumer.

### Phase 6, cut over and retire third parties

Run regression and rollback checks, switch production traffic, observe the agreed rollback window, then remove Vercel, Supabase, Gemini, PostHog and Sentry configuration and dependencies. Handle `resend` only if its production use is confirmed.

Exit criteria: Azure serves all production paths, old-provider credentials are revoked, obsolete dependencies are removed, and deployment and recovery documentation describes the running system.

## Speech SKU gotcha

Deployed account is `ccl-pronunciation-speech-david`. The source Bicep now requires that explicit name, but the compiled template must be rebuilt before deployment. Do not deploy a stale `main.json` that still contains the former generated-name behavior.

```
az cognitiveservices account update \
  --name ccl-pronunciation-speech-david \
  --resource-group ccl-pronunciation-trainer-rg \
  --sku S0
```

After the SKU update, keep `main.bicepparam` and deployed reality aligned. The explicit account name is the single source of truth.

## Capability boundary

Which work can be done through the contextpatch MCP servers and which requires a human at a terminal or a browser. Recorded because misjudging this wastes a session.

### Can be done through MCP

The contextpatch servers are repo-confined edit engines with an allowlist of `git`, `cargo`, `bun`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `python3`, `pytest`, `rg`, and one exact bash script.

* Read, write and edit any file in ccl-pronunciation-trainer, datacore-platform and contextpatch
* Author and revise Bicep, TypeScript, SQL and documentation
* Search either codebase to ground a claim in what the code says
* Run the test suites, typecheck and lint
* Stage, commit, push, open pull requests

### Cannot be done through MCP

`az` is not on the allowlist and no cloud API is reachable from any of the 52 actions. Everything below needs a human.

| Blocked | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `az bicep build` | requires `az` |
| Any deployment | requires `az` and interactive authentication |
| Speech `F0` to `S0` | requires `az` |
| Reading Cost Management | requires portal or `az`, and is the only way to verify the daily floor |
| Confirming resource state | same |
| Anything needing credentials | no secret material is reachable, by design |

### Optional improvement

Microsoft ships an official Azure MCP Server covering 40 or more services, installable with `npx -y @azure/mcp@latest server start`, authenticating through Entra ID. A separate Resource Graph server handles subscription queries and ARM deployment management.

That would close the read gap: resource state, Cost Management queries, daily floor verification. It would not help with initial deployment, since authentication happens before the server starts and the raw `az deployment` output is worth seeing directly.

If adopted, scope it to a service principal with Contributor on `ccl-pronunciation-trainer-rg` rather than attaching the Owner identity. Owner can delete resource groups, read Key Vault secrets and create role assignments; nothing in this plan needs that.

Not a prerequisite. Set it up after the clock is running.

## Implementation todos

Work top to bottom unless a dependency explicitly permits parallel work. Check a row only when its acceptance condition is true.

Owner: **H** requires Azure access or a product decision; **A** is repository implementation; **A+H** requires both.

### Current state

Infrastructure definitions exist but have not been compiled as a complete set. No application migration task above is complete. The trainer still runs on Supabase, Gemini, Vercel and PostHog, and nothing in `src/` or `api/` consumes the planned PostgreSQL, Redis, Front Door or APIM resources.

The immediate blocking evidence is IAC-00 and IAC-01, plus IN-01 through IN-03 before what-if. While a human obtains those results, repository work can begin on the V0 baseline, APP-01/APP-03, DB-01, AUTH-01 and OPT-01 because none depends on an Azure deployment.

## Validation gates

Passing a phase means retaining evidence for its gate, not only completing the code edits.

| Gate | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| V0, baseline | Record the existing results of `pnpm run build`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm run validate:all` before migration code changes, separating pre-existing failures from regressions |
| V1, infrastructure | Successful Bicep build; SKU, quota and runtime availability evidence; reviewed what-if; no unexpected replacement or duplicate Speech account |
| V2, App Service and API | Production-package build; server and route tests; live smoke tests for root, deep link, `/health` and all six routes both directly where allowed and through APIM; CORS, method, auth, throttling and error cases exercised |
| V3, data and auth | Repeatable migration dry run; schema and record-count reconciliation; sampled checksums and ownership mappings; timed database and auth rollback rehearsals; web and Capacitor sign-in/recovery coverage |
| V4, service integrations | Front Door cache/CORS/WAF checks; Blob cache-hit proof; Application Insights event and exception traces; Foundry timeout/error tests; Redis hit, miss, TTL and key-isolation metrics |
| V5, cutover | `pnpm run build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm run validate:all` and the applicable Playwright suite pass; production smoke tests pass on web and Capacitor; restore and rollback instructions have named owners |

## Migration definition of done

The repository migration is complete only when:

* Front Door, APIM and App Service serve every production web, API and audio path on an explicitly supported runtime and approved production tiers.
* PostgreSQL is reachable only through the server API, Entra External ID owns production authentication, existing identities and progress reconcile, and guest/offline behavior is preserved.
* Foundry handles production AI traffic, Redis has a measured genuine consumer, and Application Insights receives the required telemetry and errors.
* WAF and origin-bypass controls are deployed, no browser bundle contains server credentials or APIM master keys, and least-privilege identities are documented.
* IaC builds reproducibly, deployment what-if is reviewed, any retained compiled template matches source, and restore plus rollback rehearsals have succeeded.
* The rollback window has closed, retired-provider credentials and runtime dependencies are removed, and setup, deployment, recovery and architecture documentation matches production.

Billing qualification is a separate operations acceptance criterion. It neither substitutes for these engineering conditions nor makes an unused service complete.

## Dates

These are planning references, not evidence that the milestone clock has started.

| Date | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 6 Aug 2026 | Plan baseline; not a qualifying clock start |
| T0 | First day Cost Management confirms at least five genuine service types each meet the required spend floor |
| 60th consecutive qualifying day | Candidate milestone completion; confirm Microsoft's inclusive-day interpretation and progression status |
| 22 Dec 2026 | Current credit expiry |

The previously stated 5 October date is valid only if 6 August is verified as T0. This plan explicitly records that the clock had not started on 6 August, so 5 October must not be used as the active deadline.

## Open questions

For Microsoft support or Q&A, with specifics rather than in the abstract.

1. Do two Cognitive Services accounts of different kinds count as two workloads, or one?
2. Do multiple resources inside one service, for example several container apps in one environment, count once or severally?
3. Is the US$1 floor cumulative across the window, or per day?
4. If retained or conditional services eventually bring the total to eight workloads and qualify directly for the $50,000 milestone, does the two year credit extension documented at $25,000 still trigger? Fifty thousand expiring 22 December would be worse than twenty five thousand that does not.
5. Is progression genuinely automatic? The portal shows no upgrade affordance, matching the documentation, but multiple reports describe weeks of silence after apparently qualifying.

## Unresolved, non-technical

`rg-syntion-dev` runs employer development inside a subscription verified against a personal entity. Worth a deliberate decision rather than drift.

## Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Daily floor is the wrong reading and the higher fixed tiers were unnecessary | confirm open question three before committing to the 60-day operating window |
| A service provisioned at too small a tier reads compliant monthly but fails daily | verify per service in Cost Management at daily granularity before assuming the clock started |
| Selected SKU, quota or Node 22 runtime is unavailable in `australiaeast` | verify subscription-specific availability before what-if and record an approved substitution before changing Bicep |
| Redis or API Management judged contrived under the genuine use condition | remove one and retain five services at roughly US$255 or US$246; removing both leaves four and requires a justified replacement |
| Front Door is described as WAF-protected but no policy is associated | make WAF policy deployment, endpoint association and origin-bypass verification a Phase 0 gate |
| APIM Developer carries production traffic despite having no SLA | require IN-07 and CUT-00 before production cutover; select an available SLA-backed tier or time-box explicit risk acceptance |
| Auth migration overruns the window | it does not block the App Service/API vertical slice or the separate resource-provisioning track |
| Foundry left unthrottled | consumes the balance by roughly 9 September and the redesign is moot; keep the operations throttle independent of implementation phases |
| Program terms change | portal shows PREVIEW, initial grant already moved from $1,000 to $200 in under two months. Avoid large architectural commitments justified only by credits |
| Provider lock-in after credits expire | acknowledged cost of the all-Azure direction. Foundry replaces a portable inference layer, so post-credit routing to a cheaper host becomes a project rather than a config change. At roughly US$296/mo this is a real recurring bill once credits end |
| A calendar estimate is mistaken for T0 | derive the milestone date only from the first verified qualifying day and reset it after any non-qualifying day |
